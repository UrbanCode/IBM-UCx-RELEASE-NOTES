<h3>Mark a release as complete</h3>
The status of a release can be changed to complete when all deployments are complete or when no deployments are associated with the release. By marking the release complete, no further actions can be performed on it. All release and deployment related operations are disabled for the release.

This feature requires that the <strong>Release Completion</strong> permission be assigned. By default, this permission is assigned to the Release Manager role.
