6.1.1.11 - August 31, 2015
==========================




This release of IBM UrbanCode Release is a maintenance release containing bug fixes and performance improvements.

Improved Scheduled Deployments Caching Strategy (Server Side)
-------------------------------------------------------------


Scheduled Deployments are cached on the server side and will load faster. The first load of a scheduled deployment will load the data from the database and save it in the cache. Subsequent loads should get the data from the cache. Any changes made to the plan will trigger a refresh of the cache and all users will load the new version of the scheduled deployment plan directly from the cache.  

Now even plans with hundreds of tasks should load quickly and UCR will scale far better for large number of users. This will significantly improve the user experience and save resources by limiting expensive load of data.


 


Faster Load of Scheduled Deployments (Client Side)
--------------------------------------------------


Segments are now drawn asynchronously in order to display scheduled deployment plans faster.
