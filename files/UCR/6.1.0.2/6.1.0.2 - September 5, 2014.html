<h1>Experimental Features</h1>
<p>The following features are experimental, and are available only if a special product configuration is enabled. They are offered for testing and feedback, without support, and are not guaranteed to continue in any form in a future release. Please consider enabling these features in a testing environment and provide feedback via the developerWorks Q&amp;A forum.</p>

<h2>{Experimental} Third-party Plugin Support</h2>
<p>We have a new and improved system for building your own plug-ins to work with UrbanCode Release!</p>
<p>To enable this feature for testing, add this line to the server.properties file in the UrbanCode Release product configuration directory: <code>feature.integration.plugin=yes</code></p>
<p>If you are familiar with writing plug-ins for IBM UrbanCode Deploy, writing plug-ins for IBM UrbanCode Release will be straight forward. It consists of defining the UI and steps in a plugin.xml and use groovy scripts to handle the integration.</p>
<p>A demo plug-in is available as an example here: <a href="com.urbancode.plugin.google.calendar_1.zip">Google Calendar Demo Plug-in for IBM UrbanCode Release</a></p>
<p>This plug-in can be uploaded as it is (zip) on the Integration Provider page by clicking on the Upload Plug-in button. Once imported you can select the plug-in as an Integration Provider type when creating a new Integration.</p>
<p>The IBM Installation Manager provides Groovy 2.1.9 which is necessary to write your own plug-ins.</p>
<p><strong>/!\</strong> For some linux environments an extra manual step might be needed to setup the GROOVY_HOME on the environment path:</p>
<p>It can be done by running the following command =&gt; export GROOVY_HOME=$GROOVY_HOME: /ucr…location<em>/</em>UCRelease/groovy-2.1.9/</p>
<p>In the /ucr..location<em>/</em>UCRelease/groovy-2.1.9/bin/startGroovy script, make sure that the line #270  includes the argument  $JAVA_OPTS  and looks like the following   exec “$JAVACMD” $JAVA_OPTS \</p>
<p>Make sure that the Groovy folder has executable permissions: <code>chmod -R 755 groovy-2.1.9/</code></p>

<h2>{Experimental} RTC integration synchronizes defect severity</h2>
<p>You can now synchronize Severities in RTC to track Severity 1 or Severity 2 defects in UrbanCode Release.  The count of S1 and S2 defects associated with an Application on a Release can now be seen on the release detail page.</p>

<p>To enable this feature for testing, add this line to the server.properties file in the UrbanCode Release product configuration directory: <code>feature.severity.rtc.integration=yes</code></p>
</div>
<div class="new_release_cont">
<h2>{Experimental} Map RTC Work Items to Initiatives</h2>
<p>When setting up an integration with RTC, you can choose work item types that you want to be synchronized as Initiatives, rather than Changes, in UrbanCode Release.  Work Items that are children of Work Items that are integrated as Initiatives will become Changes assigned to those Initiatives in UrbanCodeRelease.</p>
<p>To enable this feature for testing, add this line to the server.properties file in the UrbanCode Release product configuration directory: <code>feature.initiative.rtc.integration=yes</code></p>
</div>
<div class="new_release_cont">
<h2>{Experimental} Updated Timeline View</h2>
<p>Timeline view has been updated to show a navigational overview of all deployments, with adjustable detail view to show any length of time within that span.</p>
