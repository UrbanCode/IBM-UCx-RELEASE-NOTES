{Experimental} Track Red/Yellow/Green status for Applications on a Release
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


You can now track the state of individual applications on a give release, setting them to red/yellow/green status to provide a better at-a-glance state of the release. Each status change can be accompanied by a short commentary elaborating on the reason for the change, and will indicate which user made the last change.


To enable this feature for testing, add this line to the server.properties file in the UrbanCode Release product configuration directory: `feature.red.yellow.green.applications=yes`
