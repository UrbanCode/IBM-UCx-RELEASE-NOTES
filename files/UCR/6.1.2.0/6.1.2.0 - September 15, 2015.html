<h2>Task Level Dependencies</h2>
<p>Previously you could only set prerequisites for segments but now you can also set a task as a prerequisite for another task within the same scheduled deployment. You can add both prerequisites and dependents of a task. This works in conjunction with segment prerequisites and the segments execution pattern.<br/>

<h2>New UI for Scheduled Deployments and Deployment Plans</h2>
<p>There is a new UI to accompany the task level dependencies that allows for more tasks to be displayed in the window. This also includes a new task dialog box which replaces the task drop down.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2>Task Filtering</h2>
<p>You can now filter tasks on the scheduled deployments page so that you don’t have to go through the whole plan to find tasks that are pertinent to you. You can filter based on any combination of Role/Group, User, Type of Task(Manual/Automated), Status of the task, application, or task tags.<br/>
