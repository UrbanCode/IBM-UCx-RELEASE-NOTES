<h2>Automatically Select Versions and/or Start Manually Scheduled Deployments</h2>
<p><a href="autostartdeployments.png"><img alt="Deployment Request Dialog with Auto-Start Options" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3384" height="250" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="autostartdeployments.png" srcset="AutoStartDeployments-300x250.png 300w, autostartdeployments.png 445w" width="300"/></a></p>
<p>Deployments that are requested manually can now be configured to automatically select deployment contents using the latest application versions that pass quality criteria, also known as “gates” on the lifecycles page, or via a matching pattern on version names.  It is also possible to start the deployment automatically at the selected start time.  These features were previously available only for deployments created via recurring deployment rules.
</p></div>
<div class="new_release_cont">
<h2>Copy Releases</h2>
<p><a href="releasecopy.png"><img alt="ReleaseCopy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-3386" height="109" src="releasecopy.png" width="248"/></a></p>
<p>It is now possible to copy an existing release from the release list page.  Copied releases are configured with the same applications, release environments, approvals, deployment plans, and milestones as the original release.  Milestone are reset to the “Not Started” status.
</p></div>
<div class="new_release_cont">
<h2>Hide Tasks that are Not Applicable</h2>
<p><a href="hidenotapplicable.png"><img alt="HideNotApplicable" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3385" height="118" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="hidenotapplicable.png" srcset="HideNotApplicable-300x118.png 300w, hidenotapplicable.png 396w" width="300"/></a></p>
<p>Hide all tasks that are not applicable to the current environment or selected deployment contents with a single click on the deployment details page.
</p></div>
<div class="new_release_cont">
<h2>Improved Integration Performance with UrbanCode Deploy</h2>
<p>For customers with large installations, data will synchronize from UrbanCode Deploy to UrbanCode Release in significantly less time than with past releases.  Note that this improvement also requires the use of UrbanCode Deploy 6.0.1.1 or higher.
</p></div>
<div class="new_release_cont">
<h2>Improved Performance on the All Deployments Tab</h2>
<p>Performance of the “All” tab in the Deployments section has been significantly improved.
</p></div>
<div class="new_release_cont">
<h2>More Editing Operations</h2>
<p>Applications that were created within UrbanCode Release can now be edited and deleted. (However, applications synchronized with UrbanCode Deploy cannot be deleted within UrbanCode Release.) Deployment plans can be deleted, if they are not actively being used in a release phase or a scheduled deployment that has not yet been started.
</p></div>
<p></p>
<div class="new_release_cont">
<h1>Experimental Features</h1>
<p>The following features are experimental, and are available only if a special product configuration is enabled.  They are offered for testing and feedback, without support, and are not guaranteed to continue in any form in a future release.  Please consider enabling these features in a testing environment and provide feedback via the developerWorks Q&amp;A forum.
</p></div>
<div class="new_release_cont">
<h2>{Experimental} New Segment Dependency Graph View in Federated Deployment Dashboards</h2>
<p>Federated deployment dashboards can now have an alternate view, which displays segments on a timeline similar to a Gantt chart.  Status information about segments and tasks is available via color, position, and a detail box displayed on mouse hover.</p>
<p><a href="segmentdependencygraph.png"><img alt="Segment Dependency Graph View" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3387" height="107" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="segmentdependencygraph.png" srcset="SegmentDependencyGraph-300x107.png 300w, segmentdependencygraph.png 809w" width="300"/></a></p>
<p>To enable this feature for testing, add this line to the server.properties file in the UrbanCode Release product configuration directory:</p>
<p>feature.segment.dependency.graph.enabled=yes
</p></div>
<div class="new_release_cont">
<h2>{Experimental} Release Target Date &amp; Milestone Sequences</h2>
<p>With this experimental feature enabled, releases can now be configured with a target date, e.g. for the expected date of production deployment.</p>
<p>Milestone sequences allow release milestones to be reused across multiple releases without repeat data entry.  A milestone sequence is composed of milestone templates, and each milestone template can be scheduled for a specified number of days before or after the release target date.  </p>
<p>A lifecycle can be configured to include a milestone sequence, and each new release created with the lifecycle will automatically be configured with the full milestone sequence.  </p>
<p>A milestone sequence can also be applied to a release on the release detail page.</p>
<p>To enable this feature for testing, add this line to the server.properties file in the UrbanCode Release product configuration directory:</p>
<p>feature.milestone.template.enabled=yes
</p></div>
<div class="new_release_cont">
<h2>{Experimental} Environment Reservations &amp; Active Release for Environment</h2>
<p>This experimental feature allows a release environment to be reserved for use for a specific phase of a release over a range of dates.  More than one reservation can be placed, allowing for multiple date ranges.  If a conflict is detected for a release environment reservation, a warning will be displayed to the user, detailing the potential conflicts.</p>
<p>In addition to the new user interface, this feature also provides a new integration with UrbanCode Deploy.  Using a new plugin for UrbanCode Deploy, a component deployment process can be configured to detect the currently-active release for the destination application environment of the deployment.  This information can then be used for other component process steps, such as creating a snapshot with a name that includes the targeted release name.</p>
<p>To enable this feature for testing, add this line to the server.properties file in the UrbanCode Release product configuration directory:</p>
<p>feature.environment.reservation.enabled=yes
