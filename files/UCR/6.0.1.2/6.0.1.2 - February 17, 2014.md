6.0.1.2 - February 17, 2014
===========================





This release of IBM UrbanCode Release is a maintenance release containing bug fixes and a few minor enhancements. This release is recommended for all customers.


Support for new UrbanCode Release plugin for UrbanCode Deploy
-------------------------------------------------------------


A new plugin is available for UrbanCode Deploy to support specific integration scenarios with UrbanCode Release, driven from component processes in Deploy. Two plugin steps are currently available:


### Add Snapshot Status


This step allows a process to mark a snapshot or component version with a specific status and optionally upload an attachment or add a comment to the status in UrbanCode Release.

### Get Release for Environment


This step works with the experimental Environment Reservation feature introduced in [UrbanCode Release 6.0.1.1](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/urbancode-releasewhats-new/whats-new-urbancode-release-6-0-1-1/). Using this step, a Deploy process can query UrbanCode Release to determine the name of the release for which the current application environment is assigned. This name can then be used in other steps in the process, e.g. as part of a snapshot name or to perform branching logic within the process.
