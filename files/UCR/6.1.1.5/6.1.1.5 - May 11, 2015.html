<h2>New IBM UrbanCode Deploy Plugin</h2>
<ul>
<li>The built-in UCD integration has been converted into a plugin.</li>
<li>The plugin has significantly better performance than the integration due to having the capability to perform a delta-sync rather than a full import on each sync.</li>
<li>We encourage existing customers to set their old integration to “Manual Update” then import the plugin and set it to run once a minute.</li>
<li>The plugin requires IBM UrbanCode Deploy version 6.1.1.4 and above. A patch is available for IBM UrbanCode Deploy 6.1.1.3 as well.</li>
</ul>
