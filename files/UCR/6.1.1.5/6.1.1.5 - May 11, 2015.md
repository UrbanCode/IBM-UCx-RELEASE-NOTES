6.1.1.5 - May 11, 2015
======================




This release of IBM UrbanCode Release is a maintenance release containing [bug fixes](./release-notes/).

New IBM UrbanCode Deploy Plugin
-------------------------------


* The built-in UCD integration has been converted into a plugin.
* The plugin has significantly better performance than the integration due to having the capability to perform a delta-sync rather than a full import on each sync.
* We encourage existing customers to set their old integration to “Manual Update” then import the plugin and set it to run once a minute.
* The plugin requires IBM UrbanCode Deploy version 6.1.1.4 and above. A patch is available for IBM UrbanCode Deploy 6.1.1.3 as well.




Group Assignment
----------------


* Tasks can now be assigned to either a role or a group.




Timezones for Recurring Rules
-----------------------------


* When creating a recurring rule, you can now select the timezone for that rule.
* Existing rules will default to the server’s timezone.


Release Summary
---------------

  
* New UCD Plugin
* Group Assignment for Tasks
