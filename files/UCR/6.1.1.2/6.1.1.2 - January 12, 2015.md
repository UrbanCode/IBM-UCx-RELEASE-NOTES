Installation Notes
Unless it has already been set, the path to groovy home is now automatically set during both fresh installation and upgrade in server.properties (groovy.home.path). Note that release will always use the value at groovy.home.path over any shell environment variables. Even if you set GROOVY\_HOME, release will use the groovy specified in `groovy.home.path`.
