6.1.1.10 - August 7, 2015
=========================




This release of IBM UrbanCode Release is a maintenance release containing bug fixes and new features.

Task Filtering
--------------


[![filter screenshot](filter-screenshot.png)](filter-screenshot.png)


Tasks can be filtered on the scheduled deployment page.  

Tasks can be filtered by role/group, user, type, status, application, or tag.


You can enable this feature by adding the following line to your server.properties file: feature.filter.tasks.enabled=yes




Scheduled Deployment Caching
----------------------------


Data from scheduled deployments is now cached on the server. This greatly improves performance when a large number of users are viewing the same deployment simultaneously.  

You can adjust the lifespan of the cache with the following property in your server.properties: caching.deployment.execution.lifespan=  

The default lifespan is 60 seconds.




Task Tags can now be imported from a .CSV
-----------------------------------------


When importing a deployment plan, you can now include existing task tags with each task.




Notification Emails Include Links to Specific Tasks
---------------------------------------------------


The link in each notification email will now expand the related task and collapse other tasks. This makes it far easier to find the task mentioned in an email.
