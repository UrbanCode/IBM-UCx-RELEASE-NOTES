<h2>Scheduled Deployment Caching</h2>
<p>Data from scheduled deployments is now cached on the server.  This greatly improves performance when a large number of users are viewing the same deployment simultaneously.<br/>
You can adjust the lifespan of the cache with the following property in your server.properties: caching.deployment.execution.lifespan=<time in="" seconds=""><br/>
The default lifespan is 60 seconds.
</time></p></div>
<div class="new_release_cont">
<h2>Task Tags can now be imported from a .CSV</h2>
<p>When importing a deployment plan, you can now include existing task tags with each task.
</p></div>
<div class="new_release_cont">
<h2>Notification Emails Include Links to Specific Tasks</h2>
<p>The link in each notification email will now expand the related task and collapse other tasks.  This makes it far easier to find the task mentioned in an email.
