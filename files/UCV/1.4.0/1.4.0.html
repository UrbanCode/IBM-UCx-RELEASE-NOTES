<p><h1>1.4.0</h1></p>
<p>Starting with the March 1, 2019 release, UrbanCode Velocity is using semantic versioning for product releases. The semantic versioning contains a three-part version number: major version, minor version, and patch. At any given time, only the latest two releases are available. Always download the latest version. For download information, see the <strong>Getting Started</strong> tab.
<h2>Key Features in 1.4.0</h2>
The following enhancements are included in each release. In addition to various bug fixes.
<h3>New Community Edition</h3>
In UrbanCode Velocity v1.4.0, we have reimagined our Community Edition. Now, the IBM UrbanCode Velocity Community Edition is combined into the primary install to create a simplified experience. Instead of being limited to the UrbanCode Deploy Audit Reports, the Community Edition opens the entire product, limited to two users, for free.

<strong>Note:</strong> This Community Edition version replaces the original Community Edition. The older version is no longer supported. You must migrate to the new version.

<h3>Work Type Distribution and Throughput</h3>
Two metrics have been added to the Value Streams and Insights dashboards.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Work Type Distribution</strong> - The percentage of items by type in the value stream.</li>
 	<li><strong>Throughout</strong> - The number of items that have reached a specified stage in a given amount of time.</li>
</ul>
