**Key Features/Enhancements in 2.0.3**
--------------------------------------





Performance updates

* Improvements made for paginating user tables to increase performance when loading user lists.
* The time it takes to load a list of Jenkins jobs when mapping a list to environment has been improved.
* Improvements made to processing of manual tasks to improve processing time and eliminate an error exception logged when an imported task did not have the **groupsAndUsers** property defined.



Plug-in updates
Parser type plug-in code has been updated to fix a problem with the NPM wrapper when there are no plug-in properties.
Bug fixes

* Integration with UrbanCode Deploy 7.1.0.1 fails with HTTP status code 500. This has been resolved by UrbanCode Deploy 7.1.0.1iFix01.
* Bottleneck detection errors are not handled well for value streams with data creation errors. Algorithm updated and more verbose reporting when bottleneck detected.
* Edit icon does not display when hovering over chart.

**Key Features/Enhancements in 2.0.2**
--------------------------------------


* Task dependencies can be added to deployment plans through the user interface.
* Plugin image versions are now displayed on plugin page.
* Improved reserved participants to include LDAP and SSO users and check reservation availability.
* Added LDAP and SSO users alongside local users in a single users list.
* Bottleneck detection is now based on Lead Time definition.


Bug Fixes
---------


* Gating is now applied when trying to join a release.
* Fixed issue where, a brandnew snapshot not being synced, could prevent autopromotion in pipelines.
* Fixed issue where a previous input version could still appear as pipeline input.
* Fixes an issue where properties were not displayed if pipeline stages were skipped.
* Fixed an issue where dots needed to unlink properly to show in the correct stage.
* Fixed an issue where dots could show in wrong stage if team issues were linked to multiple integration IDs.
* Fixed an issue that only counted active users for the reserved participant count.
* Fixed issue that prevented parser plugin updates from taking effect.
* New upgrade script to remove overlinking from history so that long histories can show.


**Key Features/Enhancements in 2.0.1**
--------------------------------------


* Added deployment plan visibility into task pre-requisites and dependencies.
* Improved UI to display LDAP and SSO user list.

Bug Fixes
---------


* Fixed issue with reporting consumer service reconnecting to database.
* Fixed issue with defaultValue for plugin SDK custom properties not displaying in configuration UI.

### Scalability of services


The main UrbanCode Velocity services can now scale to handle larger installations and greater amounts of data.
### Locking of releases


The release manger can change a release status to lock. No changes can be made to the release after it is locked. Request for changes must be This gives the release manager control over last minute changes and ensures no changes are made after a final review. The lock is set on the Release Overflow page.
### Environment gating


Users can now manually approve versions and gate environments based on approvals. The gate fails if approval requirements are not met. If a version does not pass all approvals the release manager can override the deployment. This feature provides for governance and compliance of open source tools and fragmented tools. This feature is located on the Environment Overflow page.
### Built in reports


A new State of Sprint report allows for gathering statics of the value stream in relationship to a sprint. This report is helpful to a scrum master or manager in reducing risk of the current sprint and look at older sprints. You can access the report on the Reports page.
### Plug-in SDK


Using the plug-in SDK you can create your own plug-ins and upload them to UrbanCode Velocity. To access to the plug-in SDK, click **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Download Plugin SDK**.
### Bottleneck detection


Using machine learning, the model looks at current and previous state of a value stream to determine which stage the user should focus on first. This algorithm is always updating with new information to locate the next largest bottleneck. Types of bottlenecks include:
* Long Wait Time - the average time of stage is longer than any other by a substantial amount
* Batching - items pile up then are released at the same time
* In-Flow and out-flow mismatch


See the Value Stream page **Metrics Bar** or **Metrics Table** fields.
### Contributor and Load Metrics


Two new metrics are now available: Contributor Count and Load Count
* Contributor count shows how many users are working on items in the Value Stream. The metric is based off the stages in Lead Time (work select -> customer) and counts how many unique individual owned items in those stages. Allows the tool to compare other metrics to rationalize about other metrics.
* Load is also based off Lead Time and is a count of all the items in the stages at any given time. This allows you to see if there is a correlation of how much work is truly in progress vs how much is getting done. Usually there is a sweet spot to not give too much work and get the right amount out. With both our metrics are in a state where we can start rationalizing about different strategies without customers and how to use them correctly. See the Value Stream page **Metrics Bar** or **Metrics Table** fields.
