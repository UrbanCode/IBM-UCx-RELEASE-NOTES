     Install the server
    </h3>
    There are two option to obtaining the installation package: online installer and offline installer. Both options will require a master license key, which can be acquired from:
    <ul>
     <li>
      <a href="https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
       IBM Passport Advantage
      </a>
      – Use this option if you have purchased IBM UrbanCode Velocity.

     </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="subtitle">
     Online installer
    </h3>
    The online installer option for installing the product requires an internet connection for the entire process. It requires minimum storage for the downloaded package. The downloaded image contains only the Helm charts used to pull the product Docker images from a GitHub location. This is our recommended installation method.

Download the online installer package depending on the platform, the product is being installed.

    After the download completes, start the executable file to begin the install process.
    <h3 class="subtitle">
     Offline installer
    </h3>
    The offline installer process allows for installation of product without an internet connection. You’ll need a connection only to download the product image. All containers needed to successfully install the product are included. For this reason, the images requires more space when downloading.

The installation package is available from
    <a href="https://www-945.ibm.com/support/fixcentral" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
     IBM FixCentral
    </a>
    . Search and select the installation package appropriate for the installation platform.

After downloading the the installation package, decompress the contents into two directories, one for Kubernetes and the other for Docker Compose. The instructions for installing the server are located in the product documentation, see the
    <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCKX6_1.0.0/com.ibm.velocity.doc/topics/c_install_se_roadmap.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
     Installation
    </a>
    topic.

To obtain the product license key you must agree to the terms and condition statements provided on Passport Advantage. The license key is required to start the install process for the initial and future installations.
