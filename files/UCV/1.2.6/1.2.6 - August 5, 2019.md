Development teams and DevOps transformation leaders can now visualize work moving through their value stream in real-time so that they can work to eliminate bottlenecks, reduce wait times to gain speed without compromising quality.

UrbanCode Velocity integrates with many tracking, source control management, build, and test tools such as Jira, GitHub, BitBucket and SonarQube.

UrbanCode Velocity value stream management is built on the idea of configuration as code, which allows a user to customize their workflow using the UrbanCode DevOps query language. This enables UrbanCode Velocity value stream management to mold,model and reuse pipelines, processes, and methodologies.

In addition to the introduction of value stream management, this release contains bugfixes and enhancements to the existing Pipeline, Releases, and Reporting components such as, improved integration with UrbanCode Deploy and auto-promotion in UrbanCode Velocity.Release Summary

Plan & Prepare

For supported platforms and requirements you can dynamically generate a system requirements report using the [Software Product Compatibility Reports (SPCR)](https://www.ibm.com/software/reports/compatibility/clarity/index.html) tool.
Install the server
------------------


There are two option to obtaining the installation package: online installer and offline installer. Both options will require a master license key, which can be acquired from:
* [IBM Passport Advantage](https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/) - Use this option if you have purchased IBM UrbanCode Velocity.
* [Trial Installation](https://www.uc-velocity.com/) - Use this option if you would like to try IBM UrbanCode Velocity.


### Online installer


The online installer option for installing the product requires an internet connection for the entire process. It requires minimum storage for the downloaded package. The downloaded image contains only the Helm charts used to pull the product Docker images from a GitHub location. This is our recommended installation method.

Download the online installer package depending on the platform, the product is being installed.
- [Linux](https://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/products/UrbanCode/Velocity/latest/velocity-se-ibm-install-latest-linux)
- [Mac OS](https://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/products/UrbanCode/Velocity/latest/velocity-se-ibm-install-latest-macos)
- [Windows](https://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/products/UrbanCode/Velocity/latest/velocity-se-ibm-install-latest-win.exe)

After the download completes, start the executable file to begin the install process.
### Offline installer


The offline installer process allows for installation of product without an internet connection. You'll need a connection only to download the product image. All containers needed to successfully install the product are included. For this reason, the images requires more space when downloading.

The installation package is available from [IBM FixCentral](https://www-945.ibm.com/support/fixcentral). Search and select the installation package appropriate for the installation platform.

After downloading the the installation package, decompress the contents into two directories, one for Kubernetes and the other for Docker Compose. The instructions for installing the server are located in the product documentation, see the [Installation](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCKX6_1.2.x/com.ibm.uvelocity.doc/topics/c_install_se_roadmap.html) topic.

To obtain the product license key you must agree to the terms and condition statements provided on Passport Advantage. The license key is required to start the install process for the initial and future installations.
