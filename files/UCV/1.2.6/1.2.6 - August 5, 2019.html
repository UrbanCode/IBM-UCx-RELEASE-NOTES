   Development teams and DevOps transformation leaders can now visualize work moving through their value stream in real-time so that they can work to eliminate bottlenecks, reduce wait times to gain speed without compromising quality.

UrbanCode Velocity integrates with many tracking, source control management, build, and test tools such as Jira, GitHub, BitBucket and SonarQube.

UrbanCode Velocity value stream management is built on the idea of configuration as code, which allows a user to customize their workflow using the UrbanCode DevOps query language.

In addition to the introduction of value stream management, this release contains bugfixes and enhancements to the existing Pipeline, Releases, and Reporting components such as, improved integration with UrbanCode Deploy and auto-promotion in UrbanCode Velocity.

   <h3>
    Online installer
   </h3>
   The online installer option for installing the product requires an internet connection for the entire process. It requires minimum storage for the downloaded package. The downloaded image contains only the Helm charts used to pull the product Docker images from a GitHub location. This is our recommended installation method.

Download the online installer package depending on the platform, the product is being installed.

   <h3>
    Offline installer

   </a>
   . Search and select the installation package appropriate for the installation platform.

After downloading the the installation package, decompress the contents into two directories, one for Kubernetes and the other for Docker Compose. The instructions for installing the server are located in the product documentation, see the
   <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCKX6_1.2.x/com.ibm.uvelocity.doc/topics/c_install_se_roadmap.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
