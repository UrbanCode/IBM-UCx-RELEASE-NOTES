The <code>release-events-api</code> performance issues in Kubernetes or OpenShift installations with explicit overrides of limits and requests for memory allocations in the deployment might be caused by the overrides. The following workaround provides guidelines to address the loss of system stability that is associated with the non-default settings that were set during configuration. This issue is typical only when the preceding explicit overrides are implemented in the configuration. If more than 2 GBs of memory are required, perform the following procedure:
<ol>
	<li>Determine the memory requirement.</li>
	<li>Under <strong>spec</strong> > <strong>template</strong> > <strong>spec</strong> > <strong>containers</strong> in your YAML file, locate the following line. 
<code>image: urbancode/velocity-se-release-events-api:x.x.x.xx
 </code></li>
	<li>Add the command override as a sibling entry to the line located in the previous step. The command is shown below.
    <code>
     image: urbancode/velocity-se-release-events-api:x.x.x.xx
     command:
       - node
       - --max-old-space-size=<em>maximum_size</em>
       - /release-events-api/release-events-api.min.js
  </code>
       </li>
	<li>Enter the maximum memory requirement in the appropriate units on the command line. Replace the <em>maximum_size</em> variable with your value.</li>
</ol>
