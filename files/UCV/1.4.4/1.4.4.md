1.4.4
=====




Starting with the March 1, 2019 release, UrbanCode Velocity is using semantic versioning for product releases. The semantic versioning contains a three-part version number: major version, minor version, and patch. At any given time, only the latest two releases are available. Always download the latest version. For download information, see the **Getting Started** tab.
**Note:** UrbanCode Deploy v7+ users, please review the release note titled "UrbanCode Deploy Integration Creating Large Audit Database Entries" in the v1.4.3 release.

Key Features in 1.4.4
---------------------



### UrbanCode Velocity CE Login User Sessions


After quick feedback, we discovered that 2 concurrent user sessions was far too limiting. In v1.4.4, we have increased the number of users sessions allowed for a single user. 




### Logout Timer


The logout timer was too unforgiving and forced a logout after 30 minutes regardless of activity. We have since increased the logout timer so this error is experienced infrequently.



### Various Bug Fixes


* In the pipeline, when selecting a deployment with multiple UrbanCode Deploy processes, all processes run as selected.
* In Insights' Dashboards, built-in chart filter options will be consolidated into the same case insensitive word. This has not yet been implemented for custom chart metrics.





Key Features in 1.4.3

### UrbanCode Deploy Integration Creating Large Audit Database Entries


APAR PI99803 identified a significant performance issue where the UrbanCode Deploy Integration was creating a large amount of login requests when gathering deployment information. If using UrbanCode Deploy v7.0.0.0 or greater, it is highly recommended that you contact the L2 support team to obtain a performance related patch.
### Last Sync Integration Notification


Resolved issue where the Integration's last sync was not updating properly.

### New Community Edition


In UrbanCode Velocity v1.4.0, we have reimagined our Community Edition. Now, the IBM UrbanCode Velocity Community Edition is combined into the primary install to create a simplified experience. Instead of being limited to the UrbanCode Deploy Audit Reports, the Community Edition opens the entire product, limited to two users, for free.

**Note:** This Community Edition version replaces the original Community Edition. The older version is no longer supported. You must migrate to the new version.

### Prepare


For supported platforms and requirements you can dynamically generate a system requirements report using the [Software Product Compatibility Reports (SPCR)](https://www.ibm.com/software/reports/compatibility/clarity/index.html) tool.
### Install the server


There are two option to obtaining the installation package: online installer and offline installer. Both options will require a master license key, which can be acquired from:

[IBM Passport Advantage](https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/) - Use this option if you have purchased IBM UrbanCode Velocity

[Trial Installation](https://www.uc-velocity.com/) - Use this option if you would like to try IBM UrbanCode Velocity
### Online installer


The online installer option for installing the product requires an internet connection for the entire process. It requires minimum storage for the downloaded package. The downloaded image contains only the Helm charts used to pull the product Docker images from a GitHub location. This is our recommended installation method.

Download the online installer package depending on the platform, the product is being installed.
* [Linux](https://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/products/UrbanCode/Velocity/latest/velocity-se-ibm-install-latest-linux)
* [Mac OS](https://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/products/UrbanCode/Velocity/latest/velocity-se-ibm-install-latest-macos)
* [Windows](https://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/products/UrbanCode/Velocity/latest/velocity-se-ibm-install-latest-win.exe)


After the download completes, start the executable file to begin the install process.
### Offline installer


The offline installer process allows for installation of product without an internet connection. You'll need a connection only to download the product image. All containers needed to successfully install the product are included. For this reason, the images requires more space when downloading.

The installation package is available from [IBM FixCentral](https://www-945.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm%7ERational&product=ibm/Rational/IBM+UrbanCode+Velocity&release=All&platform=All&function=all). Search and select the installation package appropriate for the installation platform.

After downloading the the installation package, decompress the contents into two directories, one for Kubernetes and the other for Docker Compose. The instructions for installing the server are located in the product documentation, see the [Installation](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCKX6_1.4.x/com.ibm.uvelocity.doc/topics/c_install_se_roadmap.html) topic.

To obtain the product license key you must agree to the terms and condition statements provided on Passport Advantage. The license key is required to start the install process for the initial and future installations.
### Installation


The download package includes the installation program for both Docker Compose and Kubernetes. To obtain the license key you must first agree to the terms and condition statements provided on Passport Advantage. The license key is required to start the install process for the initial and future installations.
