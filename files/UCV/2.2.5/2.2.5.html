<h2>MongoDB version 3.6 end of support</h2>

The MongoDB version 3.6 has reached end of life and all MongoDB 3.6 instances must be upgraded to MongoDB 4.0 for IBM UrbanCode Velocity 2.3.0 to start. This upgrade applies only if you are running UrbanCode Velocity in a Docker Compose environment.

If you are upgrading or have ever upgraded from a UrbanCode Velocity version prior to v1.4.5, which was released in March 2020, you must migrate your MongoDB. The procedure to complete is described in the following table. The procedure depends on several items.
