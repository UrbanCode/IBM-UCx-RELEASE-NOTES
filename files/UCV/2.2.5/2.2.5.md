2.2.5
=====




This release of IBM UrbanCode Velocity is a maintenance release. There are no new enhancements. This release is recommended for all customers.


MongoDB version 3.6 end of support
----------------------------------



The MongoDB version 3.6 has reached end of life and all MongoDB 3.6 instances must be upgraded to MongoDB 4.0 for IBM UrbanCode Velocity 2.3.0 to start. This upgrade applies only if you are running UrbanCode Velocity in a Docker Compose environment.

If you are upgrading or have ever upgraded from a UrbanCode Velocity version prior to v1.4.5, which was released in March 2020, you must migrate your MongoDB. The procedure to complete is described in the following table. The procedure depends on several items.



|  | Scenario 1 | Scenario 2 | Scenario 3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **IBM UrbanCode Velocity version** | 1.4.4 or earlier | Upgraded from 1.4.4 or earlier to a version between 1.4.5 to 2.2.4 | New installation of 1.4.5 or higher |
| **MongoDB version** |  3.4 |  3.6 |  3.6 |
| **MongoDB compatibility flag version** |  3.4 |  3.4 |  3.6 |
| **Solution A** | Upgrade to version 2.2.5, then to 2.3.0 | Upgrade to version 2.2.5, then to 2.3.0 | Upgrade directly to version 2.3.0 |
| **Solution B** |  N/A | Run MongoDB command:

```
db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: 3.6 } )
```

to set compatibility flag to version 3.6 |  N/A |
| **Solution C** |  Contact [support](https://www.ibm.com/support/home/). | Contact [support](https://www.ibm.com/support/home/). |  N/A |


**Note:** Refer to the [MongoDB site](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/setFeatureCompatibilityVersion/) for details about the `setFeatureCompatibilityVersion` flag.Release Summary

Getting Started
---------------

  
Plan and prepare
----------------


For supported platforms and requirements you can dynamically
generate a system requirements report using the [Software Product Compatibility Reports (SPCR)](https://www.ibm.com/software/reports/compatibility/clarity/index.html) tool.
Install the server
------------------


There are two option to obtaining the installation package: online installer and offline installer. Both options require a master license key, which can be acquired from [IBM Passport Advantage](https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/).
Online installer
----------------


The online installer option for installing the product requires an internet connection for the entire process. It requires minimum storage for the downloaded package. The downloaded image contains only the Helm charts used to pull the product Docker images from a GitHub location. This is our recommended installation method.

Download the online installer package depending on the platform, the product is being installed.
* [Linux](https://www.urbancode.com/uc-downloads/Velocity/latest/velocity-ibm-install-latest-linux)
* [Mac OS](https://www.urbancode.com/uc-downloads/Velocity/latest/velocity-ibm-install-latest-macos)
* [Windows](https://www.urbancode.com/uc-downloads/Velocity/latest/velocity-ibm-install-latest-win.exe)


After the download completes, start the executable file to begin the install process.
Offline installer
-----------------


Use the offline installer to install Velocity without internet connection. You will still need internet connection at some point to download the installer itself. Once downloaded, the installer will include all containers needed to successfully install the product. For this reason, the offline installer is larger than the online installer and will require more time/bandwidth and disk space when downloading.

The installation package is available from [IBM Fix Central](https://www-945.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm%7ERational&product=ibm/Rational/IBM+UrbanCode+Velocity&release=All&platform=All&function=all). Search and select the installation package appropriate for the installation platform.

After downloading the installation package, decompress the contents into two directories: one for Kubernetes and the other for Docker Compose. See the [Installation](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCKX6_2.1.x/com.ibm.uvelocity.doc/topics/c_install_se_roadmap.html) topics in the product documentation for instructions about how to install the server.

A product license key is required to install the product. To obtain a key, you must agree to the terms and conditions provided on Passport Advantage.
