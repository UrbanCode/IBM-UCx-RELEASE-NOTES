<h2>Key Features in 1.2.0</h2>
Development teams and DevOps transformation leaders can now visualize work moving through their value stream in real-time so that they can work to eliminate bottlenecks, reduce wait times to gain speed without compromising quality.

IBM UrbanCode Velocity integrates with many tracking, source control management, build, and test tools such as Jira, GitHub, BitBucket and SonarQube.

IBM UrbanCode Velocity’s VSV is built on the idea of configuration as code, which allows a user to customize their workflow using UrbanCode’s DevOps query language. This enables Velocity’s VSVl to mold,model and reuse pipelines, processes, and methodologies.

Beyond Value Stream Visualization, IBM UrbanCode Velocity 1.2.0 contains bugfixes and enhancements to existing Pipeline, Releases, and Reporting components such as improved integration with IBM UrbanCode Deploy and auto-promotion in IBM UrbanCode Velocity.
