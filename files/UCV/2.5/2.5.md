This release of IBM UrbanCode Velocity is a maintenance release and includes bug fixes. This release is recommended for all customers.
#### Insights update


On the **Insights** page, when you click the **Reports** tab, available reports include the following:
* **Pipeline snapshot**
* **Deployment audit**
* **Deployment duration** (Beta)


#### Release deployment plans


Optimized deployment rendering for improved performance including memory, CPU, and utilization of user sessions.
#### Installations and upgrades


For installations and upgrades of OpenShift and Kubernetes, at the **Choose the platform** prompt, you are presented with `Kubernetes or OpenShift (Using Helm)` as the platform. You can currently install IBM UrbanCode Velocity using service templates and the process should yield successful results without encountering any issues.

Note: Starting with future versions, installations of IBM UrbanCode Velocity as an OpenShift application using service templates will be deprecated and you should prepare migration to using Helm charts. If you are planning to migrate to using Helm charts, create a support ticket [here](https://www.ibm.com/mysupport/s/?language=en_US) and we will help you with the transition process. Otherwise, check upcoming release notes for more details when more information is available.
#### New roles and global scope


When you click **Settings > Authorization > Roles**, roles capabilities are expanded including the following features:
* Addition of new roles.
* Security for **Value streams**, **Insights**, and **Settings.**
* Assign roles and manage global roles.

The following table is a cumulative list of fixes in the 2.5 version.


|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | On the **Value streams** page, if a work item status contains a leading number and a DQL query references that number, stage change event calculations yield correct results. |
|  | On the **Value streams** page displayed in the Chinese language, when you click on any of the filter drop-downs, the page filters properly according to your selection. |
|  |  On the **Pipelines** page on any environment except **Input**, when you click **Add gate**, modal UI text is updated for clarity. |
|  | On the **Pipelines** page, if API-driven pipelines and auto promotion are set up simultaneously, both operate properly without issues. |
|  | On the **Pipelines** page, resolved an issue with duplicate pipeline deployments occurring when both autopromotion and gates were configured on the same environment. |
|  | On the **Pipelines** page, gates failure no longer alternates between the same two jobs in any environment. |
|  | Fixed security vulnerabilities. |

Getting Started
---------------

  
Plan and prepare
----------------


For supported platforms and requirements you can dynamically generate a system requirements report using the [Software Product Compatibility Reports (SPCR)](https://www.ibm.com/software/reports/compatibility/clarity/index.html) tool.
Install the server
------------------


There are two option to obtaining the installation package: online installer and offline installer. Both options require a master license key, which can be acquired from [IBM Passport Advantage](https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/).
Online installer
----------------


The online installer option for installing the product requires an internet connection for the entire process. It requires minimum storage for the downloaded package. The downloaded image contains only the Helm charts used to pull the product Docker images from a GitHub location. This is our recommended installation method.

Download the online installer package depending on the platform, the product is being installed.
* [Linux](https://www.urbancode.com/uc-downloads/Velocity/latest/velocity-ibm-install-latest-linux)
* [Mac OS](https://www.urbancode.com/uc-downloads/Velocity/latest/velocity-ibm-install-latest-macos)
* [Windows](https://www.urbancode.com/uc-downloads/Velocity/latest/velocity-ibm-install-latest-win.exe)


After the download completes, start the executable file to begin the install process.
Offline installer
-----------------


Use the offline installer to install Velocity without internet connection. You will still need internet connection at some point to download the installer itself. Once downloaded, the installer will include all containers needed to successfully install the product. For this reason, the offline installer is larger than the online installer and will require more time/bandwidth and disk space when downloading.

The installation package is available from [IBM Fix Central](https://www-945.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm%7ERational&product=ibm/Rational/IBM+UrbanCode+Velocity&release=All&platform=All&function=all). Search and select the installation package appropriate for the installation platform.

After downloading the installation package, decompress the contents into two directories: one for Kubernetes and the other for Docker Compose. See the [documentation section on installation](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCKX6_2.3.x/com.ibm.uvelocity.doc/topics/c_install_se_roadmap.html) for instructions about how to install the server.

A product license key is required to install the product. To obtain a key, you must agree to the terms and conditions provided on Passport Advantage.
