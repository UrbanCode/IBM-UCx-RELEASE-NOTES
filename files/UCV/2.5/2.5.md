#### Insights update


On the **Insights** page, when you click the **Reports** tab, available reports include the following:
* **Pipeline snapshot**
* **Deployment audit**

#### Release deployment plans


Optimized deployment rendering for improved performance including memory, CPU, and utilization of user sessions.
#### Installations and upgrades


For installations and upgrades of OpenShift and Kubernetes, at the **Choose the platform** prompt, you are presented with `Kubernetes or OpenShift (Using Helm)` as the platform. You can currently install IBM UrbanCode Velocity using service templates and the process should yield successful results without encountering any issues.

Note: Starting with future versions, installations of IBM UrbanCode Velocity as an OpenShift application using service templates will be deprecated and you should prepare migration to using Helm charts. If you are planning to migrate to using Helm charts, create a support ticket [here](https://www.ibm.com/mysupport/s/?language=en_US) and we will help you with the transition process. Otherwise, check upcoming release notes for more details when more information is available.
