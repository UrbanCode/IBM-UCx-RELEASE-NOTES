<p><h1>1.5.4</h1></p>
<p>This page provides a summary of enhancements and bug fixes for 1.5.4 and prior 1.5.x releases. To get started with new features checkout out <a href="https://www.urbancode.com/resources/?search=&amp;product_filter%5B%5D=811">Velocity resources</a>.
<h2><strong>Key Features/Enhancements in 1.5.4</strong></h2>
<div></div>
<h3>Easier Scheduling of Release Start Time</h3>
Deployment schedulers can now specify start time when joining a release. Previously this required release managers to update the start time after creation. The scheduled deployment time is now defaulted to release start time.
<h3>Snapshots now show Individual Component Versions</h3>
Snapshots now show individual component versions from the deployment plan “Version Tab”.
<h3>Pipeline Environments no longer Require Deployment to Leading Environments</h3>
A new checkbox has been added to pipeline deployments to allow deployment of any available version. The default list of versions remains the same as before, that is, it only includes versions that have already been deployed to environments left of the target environment. The new checkbox allows this restriction to be circumvented by selecting any version if needed.
<h3>Easier Velocity Trial Extension</h3>
<div>

Velocity extended trial keys can now be entered from the UI, under settings --&gt; license management. It is still necessary to contact support to obtain a new trial key before extending.
<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
</div>
<ul>
 	<li>Fixed ability to change log level for several services</li>
 	<li>Fixed Jenkins job execution drilldown status to fully complete if the task is manually marked as completed.</li>
 	<li>Fixed issue that complicated pipeline deletion if deleted integrations were included in the vsm.</li>
 	<li>When a user goes to replace a vsm.json file, the upload form includes a warning to backup the previous vsm.json file. Velocity 1.5.4 fixes a link to download the existing vsm.json file in this warning message.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><strong>Key Features</strong><strong>/Enhancements </strong><strong>in 1.5.3</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<h3>Improved LDAP Settings Page</h3>
Added ability to import LDAP user groups by entering a username string from the LDAP settings page. The username string can include wildcards.
<h3>Improved Add/Edit Integration Forms</h3>
Advanced “hidden” fields can now be toggled from create/edit integration forms. This simplifies form usage while improving configuration.
<h3>Improved UCD Application Naming</h3>
UCD application names have better context by having their associated integration names appended.
<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Fixed partial value stream display when using FireFox and Safari browsers.</li>
 	<li>Improved integration forms: always synchronize form fields with plugin version and fixed possible checkbox bug when creating more than one integration.</li>
 	<li>Reduced value stream dot (work item) alert noise.</li>
 	<li>Improved consistency of value stream navigation from value stream “card” view.</li>
 	<li>
<div>
<div>Fixed the UrbanCode Deploy Status task to correctly identify and ignore all snapshot components that do not specify at least one component version. UrbanCode Deploy statuses can only be applied to components with versions.</div>
</div></li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Key </strong><strong>Features</strong><strong>/Enhancements </strong><strong>in</strong><strong> 1.5.0</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<h3>New Value Stream Swim Lanes view</h3>
A Value Stream Swim Lanes view is now available for all value streams. The new view reorganizes your original value steam based on assigned user. You can use this view to identify who owns certain work items and how far along these items are in the value steam. The DQL querying is available if you are looking for something specific.

<h3>New Pipeline Executor role</h3>
The new Pipeline Executor role allow teams to give developers the ability to push builds through the pipeline, but not modify them. Proper use of this role ensures good division of duties and conformity to each deployment.
<h3>Integration logs</h3>
Improvements to integration logs have been made to improve troubleshooting. Now, the last ten integration executions are saved in a log and each can be viewed. The <strong>Logs Modal</strong> dialog has been redesigned to better accommodate the additional information.
