    <strong>
     Key Features/Enhancements in 1.5.4
    </strong>
   </h2>
   <div>
   </div>
   <h3>
    Easier Scheduling of Release Start Time
   </h3>
   Deployment schedulers can now specify start time when joining a release. Previously this required release managers to update the start time after creation. The scheduled deployment time is now defaulted to release start time.
   <h3>
    Snapshots now show Individual Component Versions
   </h3>
   Snapshots now show individual component versions from the deployment plan “Version Tab”.
   <h3>
    Pipeline Environments no longer Require Deployment to Leading Environments
   </h3>
   A new checkbox has been added to pipeline deployments to allow deployment of any available version. The default list of versions remains the same as before, that is, it only includes versions that have already been deployed to environments left of the target environment. The new checkbox allows this restriction to be circumvented by selecting any version if needed.
   <h3>
    Easier Velocity Trial Extension
   </h3>
   <div>
    Velocity extended trial keys can now be entered from the UI, under settings --&gt; license management. It is still necessary to contact support to obtain a new trial key before extending.
    <h2>
     Bug Fixes
    </h2>
   </div>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Fixed ability to change log level for several services
    </li>
    <li>
     Fixed Jenkins job execution drilldown status to fully complete if the task is manually marked as completed.
    </li>
    <li>
     Fixed issue that complicated pipeline deletion if deleted integrations were included in the vsm.
    </li>
    <li>
     When a user goes to replace a vsm.json file, the upload form includes a warning to backup the previous vsm.json file. Velocity 1.5.4 fixes a link to download the existing vsm.json file in this warning message.
    </li>
   </ul>

    <strong>
     in 1.5.3
    </strong>
   </h2>
   <h3>
    Improved LDAP Settings Page
   </h3>
   Added ability to import LDAP user groups by entering a username string from the LDAP settings page. The username string can include wildcards.
   <h3>
    Improved Add/Edit Integration Forms
   </h3>
   Advanced “hidden” fields can now be toggled from create/edit integration forms. This simplifies form usage while improving configuration.
   <h3>
    Improved UCD Application Naming
   </h3>
   UCD application names have better context by having their associated integration names appended.
   <h2>
    Bug Fixes
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Fixed partial value stream display when using FireFox and Safari browsers.
    </li>
    <li>
     Improved integration forms: always synchronize form fields with plugin version and fixed possible checkbox bug when creating more than one integration.
    </li>
    <li>
     Reduced value stream dot (work item) alert noise.
    </li>
    <li>
     Improved consistency of value stream navigation from value stream “card” view.
    </li>
    <li>
     <div>
      <div>
       Fixed the UrbanCode Deploy Status task to correctly identify and ignore all snapshot components that do not specify at least one component version. UrbanCode Deploy statuses can only be applied to components with versions.

    New Value Stream Swim Lanes view
   </h3>
   A Value Stream Swim Lanes view is now available for all value streams. The new view reorganizes your original value steam based on assigned user. You can use this view to identify who owns certain work items and how far along these items are in the value steam. The DQL querying is available if you are looking for something specific.

   The new Pipeline Executor role allow teams to give developers the ability to push builds through the pipeline, but not modify them. Proper use of this role ensures good division of duties and conformity to each deployment.
   <h3>
    Integration logs
   </h3>
   Improvements to integration logs have been made to improve troubleshooting. Now, the last ten integration executions are saved in a log and each can be viewed. The
   <strong>
    Logs Modal
   </strong>
   dialog has been redesigned to better accommodate the additional information.

     <strong>
      Significant Velocity Related Performance Issues for UrbanCode Deploy prior to v7.0.5.1
     </strong>
     APAR PI99803 identified a significant UrbanCode Deploy performance issue due to the Velocity UrbanCode Deploy Integration creating a large number of login requests when gathering deployment information. This issue is resolved with UrbanCode Deploy v7.0.5.1. If you are using UrbanCode Deploy v7.0.0.0 or greater, contact the L2 support team to obtain a performance related patch.

    <li>
     <strong>
      Velocity 1.5.1 Upgrade could Prevent Access to Deployment Plans and Reports (Fixed with v1.5.2)
     </strong>
     APAR PI99806 only affects upgrades to Velocity 1.5.1, where usernames containing
     <span data-contrast="auto">
      uppercase
     </span>
     lettering can loose access to deployment plans and reports (fully lowercase names/emails are unaffected). If you have users affected by this, contact support for an immediate work around. This issue is fixed with version 1.5.2 and later (upgrading will resolve the issue).
    </li>
   </ul>
   <h2>
    Plan &amp; Prepare
   </h2>
   For supported platforms and requirements you can dynamically generate a system requirements report using the
   <a href="https://www.ibm.com/software/reports/compatibility/clarity/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
    Software Product Compatibility Reports (SPCR)
   </a>
   tool.
   <h2>
    Install the server
   </h2>
   There are two option to obtaining the installation package: online installer and offline installer. Both options will require a master license key, which can be acquired from:
   <ul>
    <li>
     <a href="https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
      IBM Passport Advantage
     </a>
     - Use this option if you have purchased IBM UrbanCode Velocity.
    </li>
    <li>
     <a href="https://www.uc-velocity.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
      Trial Installation
     </a>
     - Use this option if you would like to try IBM UrbanCode Velocity.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <h2>
    Online installer
   </h2>
   The online installer option for installing the product requires an internet connection for the entire process. It requires minimum storage for the downloaded package. The downloaded image contains only the Helm charts used to pull the product Docker images from a GitHub location. This is our recommended installation method.

Download the online installer package depending on the platform, the product is being installed.
   <ul>
    <li>
     <a href="https://www.urbancode.com/uc-downloads/Velocity/latest/velocity-ibm-install-latest-linux" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
      Linux
     </a>

      Windows
     </a>
    </li>
   </ul>
   After the download completes, start the executable file to begin the install process.
   <h2>
    Offline installer
   </h2>
   Use the offline installer to install Velocity without internet connection. You will still need internet connection at some point to download the installer itself. Once downloaded, the installer will include all containers needed to successfully install the product. For this reason, the offline installer is larger than the online installer and will require more time/bandwidth and disk space when downloading.

The installation package is available from
   <a href="https://www-945.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm%7ERational&amp;product=ibm/Rational/IBM+UrbanCode+Velocity&amp;release=All&amp;platform=All&amp;function=all" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
    IBM FixCentral
   </a>
   . Search and select the installation package appropriate for the installation platform.

After downloading the installation package, decompress the contents into two directories: one for Kubernetes and the other for Docker Compose. See the
   <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCKX6_1.5.x/com.ibm.uvelocity.doc/topics/c_install_se_roadmap.html">
    documentation section on installation
   </a>
   for instructions about how to install the server.

A product license key is required to install the product. To obtain a key, you must agree to the terms and conditions provided on Passport Advantage.
