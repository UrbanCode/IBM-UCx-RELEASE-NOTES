    New Community Edition
   </h3>
   In UrbanCode Velocity v1.4.0, we have reimagined our Community Edition. Now, the IBM UrbanCode Velocity Community Edition is combined into the primary install to create a simplified experience. Instead of being limited to the UrbanCode Deploy Audit Reports, the Community Edition opens the entire product, limited to two users, for free.
   <strong>
    Note:
   </strong>
   This Community Edition version replaces the original Community Edition. The older version is no longer supported. You must migrate to the new version.

<h3>Work Type Distribution and Throughput</h3>

   <h3>
    Online installer
   </h3>
   The online installer option for installing the product requires an internet connection for the entire process. It requires minimum storage for the downloaded package. The downloaded image contains only the Helm charts used to pull the product Docker images from a GitHub location. This is our recommended installation method.

Download the online installer package depending on the platform, the product is being installed.

   <h3>
    Offline installer
   </h3>
   The offline installer process allows for installation of product without an internet connection. You'll need a connection only to download the product image. All containers needed to successfully install the product are included. For this reason, the images requires more space when downloading.

The installation package is available from
   <a href="https://www-945.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm%7ERational&amp;product=ibm/Rational/IBM+UrbanCode+Velocity&amp;release=All&amp;platform=All&amp;function=all" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
