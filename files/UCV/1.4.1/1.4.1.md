### New Community Edition


In UrbanCode Velocity v1.4.0, we have reimagined our Community Edition. Now, the IBM UrbanCode Velocity Community Edition is combined into the primary install to create a simplified experience. Instead of being limited to the UrbanCode Deploy Audit Reports, the Community Edition opens the entire product, limited to two users, for free.

**Note:** This Community Edition version replaces the original Community Edition. The older version is no longer supported. You must migrate to the new version.
