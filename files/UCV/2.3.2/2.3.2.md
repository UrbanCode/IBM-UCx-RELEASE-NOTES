Key Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------



Pipeline enhancement
You can now edit components for a given application on the pipeline. Using the new **Manage Component** button, the application's components information is displayed allowing you to add and remove components.
On the Value Streams page, the **Value Stream**, **Swim Lanes**, and **Pipeline** tabs are now located on the right side of the page.
User interface improvements
On the dots detail page, up to three lines of the name is displayed. If there is additional information an eclipse at the end of text allows you to view more content.
When displaying pipeline environment names, spaces that were included before and after typing in a name are removed when the name is displayed in the user interface.
Value Stream table enhancement 
A value stream table now contains a feature that allows you to add and delete metrics, and add, rename, and delete value streams.
Bug fixes
On the dot details page corrected the owner value when the dot is unassigned. The owner value now contains **unassigned** instead of the Jira user who created the issue.
On the deployment plans page a copyrights plan not found error prevents the user from accessing the plan.
