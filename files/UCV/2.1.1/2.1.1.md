2.1.1
=====




The following enhancements are included in each release. In addition to various bug fixes.
**Key Features and Enhancements in 2.1.1**
------------------------------------------



Value stream updates
Long value stream names now wrap in table on **All Value Streams** tab when displayed in **View list** layout.
On **Value stream** tab under Legend, sprints are now displayed with the current sprint first followed by the previous four sprints.
When creating a new value stream and an integration using a VSM JSON file that defines a single integration and an associated link rule, the JSON file is accepted and the corresponding link rule between the two integrations is created.
Improved DLQ validation
The DQL queries containing double equal signs (==) are identified during validation, preventing the uploading of an incorrect VSM file.
Bug fixes

* Fixed inaccurate display of Dashboards bar chart representations for a single run or multiple runs in a single day.
* Corrected issue of the Pipeline page not loading when navigating to the **Value stream** tab and then quickly switching to the Pipeline tab while the value stream is still loading.
* For a Jenkins version that has been successfully deployed to an environment, repeat deployments are eliminated when there are numerous applications in the pipeline. **None** is displayed for the selected version instead of the same version available for a repeat deployment.
* Issue with pull request (PR) history loss for an issue in the VSM has been fixed to link and access any PR historical data attached to the item.

Getting Started
---------------

  
Plan and prepare
----------------


For supported platforms and requirements you can dynamically
generate a system requirements report using the [Software Product Compatibility Reports (SPCR)](https://www.ibm.com/software/reports/compatibility/clarity/index.html) tool.

Install the server
------------------


There are two option to obtaining the installation package: online installer and offline installer. Both options require a master license key, which can be acquired from [IBM Passport Advantage](https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/).
Online installer
----------------


The online installer option for installing the product requires an internet connection for the entire process. It requires minimum storage for the downloaded package. The downloaded image contains only the Helm charts used to pull the product Docker images from a GitHub location. This is our recommended installation method.

Download the online installer package depending on the platform, the product is being installed.
* [Linux](https://www.urbancode.com/uc-downloads/Velocity/latest/velocity-ibm-install-latest-linux)
* [Mac OS](https://www.urbancode.com/uc-downloads/Velocity/latest/velocity-ibm-install-latest-macos)
* [Windows](https://www.urbancode.com/uc-downloads/Velocity/latest/velocity-ibm-install-latest-win.exe)


After the download completes, start the executable file to begin the install process.
Offline installer
-----------------


Use the offline installer to install Velocity without internet connection. You will still need internet connection at some point to download the installer itself. Once downloaded, the installer will include all containers needed to successfully install the product. For this reason, the offline installer is larger than the online installer and will require more time/bandwidth and disk space when downloading.

The installation package is available from [IBM Fix Central](https://www-945.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm%7ERational&product=ibm/Rational/IBM+UrbanCode+Velocity&release=All&platform=All&function=all). Search and select the installation package appropriate for the installation platform.

After downloading the installation package, decompress the contents into two directories: one for Kubernetes and the other for Docker Compose. See the [documentation section on installation](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCKX6_2.1.x/com.ibm.uvelocity.doc/topics/c_install_se_roadmap.html) for instructions about how to install the server.

A product license key is required to install the product. To obtain a key, you must agree to the terms and conditions provided on Passport Advantage.
