   Development teams and DevOps transformation leaders can now visualize work moving through their value stream in real-time so that they can work to eliminate bottlenecks, reduce wait times to gain speed without compromising quality.

IBM UrbanCode Velocity integrates with many tracking, source control management, build, and test tools such as Jira, GitHub, BitBucket and SonarQube.

IBM UrbanCode Velocity’s Value Stream Visualization is built on the idea of configuration as code, which allows a user to customize their workflow using UrbanCode’s DevOps query language. This enables Velocity’s VSVl to mold,model and reuse pipelines, processes, and methodologies.

Beyond Value Stream Visualization, IBM UrbanCode Velocity 1.2.0 contains bug fixes and enhancements to existing Pipeline, Releases, and Reporting components such as improved integration with IBM UrbanCode Deploy and auto-promotion in IBM UrbanCode Velocity.

    </li>
   </ul>
   <h3>
    Online installer
   </h3>
   The online installer option for installing the product requires an internet connection for the entire process. It requires minimum storage for the downloaded package. The downloaded image contains only the Helm charts used to pull the product Docker images from a GitHub location. This is our recommended installation method.

Download the online installer package depending on the platform, the product is being installed.

   After the download completes, start the executable file to begin the install process.
   <h3>
    Offline installer
   </h3>
   The offline installer process allows for installation of product without an internet connection. You'll need a connection only to download the product image. All containers needed to successfully install the product are included. For this reason, the images requires more space when downloading.

The installation package is available from
   <a href="https://www-945.ibm.com/support/fixcentral" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
    IBM FixCentral
   </a>
   . Search and select the installation package appropriate for the installation platform.

After downloading the the installation package, decompress the contents into two directories, one for Kubernetes and the other for Docker Compose. The instructions for installing the server are located in the product documentation, see the
   <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCKX6_1.2.x/com.ibm.uvelocity.doc/topics/c_install_se_roadmap.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
    Installation
   </a>
   topic.
