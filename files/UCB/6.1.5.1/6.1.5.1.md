Important Information
---------------------



 If administrators are allowed to manage other users' group membership regardless of the administrator's membership in those groups, by setting the following property to **true** in the `installed.properties` file:
 
> com.urbancode.ubuild.web.admin.security.SecurityUserAdminTasks.skipAdminGroupMembershipCheck




 
In order to maintain this behavior (that is, to allow administrators to modify group membership for users whether or not the administrators are members of those groups), this property name must be changed to **skip.admin.group.membership.check.enabled**. This change is being made in UrbanCode Build 6.1.5.1 in order to move this setting under a feature flag for better visibility and easier maintenance moving forward.
