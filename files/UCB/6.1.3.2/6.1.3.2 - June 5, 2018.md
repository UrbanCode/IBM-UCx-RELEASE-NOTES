### Known Problems and Workarounds


Due to [a bug in Microsoft SQL Server’s JDBC driver that appears to have been introduced in MSSQL JDBC 6.3.3](https://github.com/Microsoft/mssql-jdbc/issues/681), upgrading UrbanCode Build to version 6.1.3.2 may fail. This bug has been fixed in MSSQL JDBC 6.5.3 ([preview version at the time of this writing](https://github.com/Microsoft/mssql-jdbc/releases)). We highly suggest users of Microsoft SQL Server to use a version of the MSSQL JDBC driver that has this fix.
