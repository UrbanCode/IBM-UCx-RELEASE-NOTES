6.1.2 - March, 2016
===================





IBM UrbanCode Build 6.1.2.0 is the first public release. It contains enhancements and fixes to prior versions.

**Product enhancements**
#### Artifact repositories



You can now store artifacts into another repository outside of the UrbanCode Build repository. For this  

release you can use UrbanCode Deploy as a repository. Artifacts are displayed on the Artifacts page for the build life  

regardless of the repository.



#### Build life statuses



You can manually add statues to a build life.



#### Process definitions versus workflow definitions



Defining templates has been streamlined. Workflow templates have become process definitions and are now configured on the Definition tab of a process template.



#### Globalization



The product user interface is available in ten languages. You can set the language within the user profile.



**Documentation enhancements**
#### Tutorial updates



The Create a Maven build project and Create a project that integrates with IBM UrbanCode Deploy tutorials have been updated to work with the latest product enhancements.



#### REST API



Reference information and instructions for using the REST API is now available in the the [Knowledge Center](https://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS8NMD_6.1.2/com.ibm.ucbuild.doc/topics/rest_api_ref_overview.html).
