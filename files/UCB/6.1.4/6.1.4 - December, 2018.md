### Plan & Prepare


For supported platforms and requirements, see the reports that can be dynamically generated using the [Software Product Compatibility Reports (SPCR)](https://www.ibm.com/software/reports/compatibility/clarity/index.html) tool.

**Note:** Some supported plug-ins have system requirements that vary from the core product. Information on system requirements for individual plug-ins is available on the download page for that plug-in.

To get started quickly, IBM UrbanCode Build is shipped with an Apache Derby database. Apache Derby is not supported for production environments. As you plan your production topology, review the [installation](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS8NMD_6.1.4/com.ibm.ucbuild.doc/topics/install_ch.html) topics in the product documentation.



### Install the server


This release is available for download from [Passport Advantage](https://www-112.ibm.com/software/howtobuy/softwareandservices/passportadvantage), requiring authentication.

You have two options for incorporating this product into your environment:
* Setup the product containers into a container management environment of your choice, see the [Running in container](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS8NMD_6.1.4/com.ibm.ucbuild.doc/topics/container_overview_c.html) section in the product documentation.
