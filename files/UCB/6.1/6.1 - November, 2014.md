Release Notes

This release of UrbanCode Build contains new features, quality improvements, and updates to supported platforms, as described in the [system requirements](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27044198)


For information on documentation and support resources, software and hardware requirements and installation steps, see the [Getting Started](../getting-started) page.





Behavioral Changes
We recommend updating all agents and plugins when upgrading to this version due to changes related to SSLv3. Your agent upgrading is mandatory. Refer to [this page](https://developer.ibm.com/urbancode/docs/upgrading-ibm-ubuild-5-0-1-3-earlier/) for more details.


Licensing transitions in this release to Rational Common Licensing. You will be required to install and configure Rational Common Licensing. During initial installation, a 60-day evaluation period can be used while setting up the licensing server.


Templates have been decoupled so that they can be configured independently of each other.


The Eclipse plugin has been updated to work with build processes that have user-overridable properties. The new version can be downloaded to Eclipse via the URL listed on the Tools page.
