Release Notes
-------------

  

This release of UrbanCode Build contains new features, quality improvements, and updates to supported platforms, as described in the [system requirements](http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/ucbuild)


For information on documentation and support resources, software and hardware requirements and installation steps, see the [Getting Started](../getting-started) page.





Behavioral Changes
We recommend updating all agents and plugins when upgrading to this version. Agents have been updated with Apache Ant 1.9.4.


A change was made to CodeStation to avoid accidental orphaning of files during build life cleanup. As part of the fix, the upgrade from older versions of IBM UrbanCode Build will involve rewriting files that may be missing. Because of this, we recommend backing up the IBM UrbanCode Build server’s `opt/codestation` directory before upgrading to 6.1.1.0. The length of the upgrade will also vary by how many build artifacts exist on the file system. While we expect most upgrades to complete in around 30 to 45 minutes, please plan for up to one or two extra hours if your server has many projects, processes, and build artifacts.


This release also contains updated versions of the [CodeStation](https://developer.ibm.com/urbancode/plugin/codestation-ubuild/), [Groovy](https://developer.ibm.com/urbancode/plugin/groovy-ubuild/), and [IBM UrbanCode Deploy](https://developer.ibm.com/urbancode/plugin/ibm-urbancode-deploy/) plugins.
