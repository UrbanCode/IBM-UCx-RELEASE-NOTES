<h2>New version of Java required</h2>
<li>Beginning in version 6.2.2, the IBM UrbanCode Deploy server and agent relays require Java&#x2122; Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8.</li>
<h2>Process Editor is easier to use</h2>
<li>The step palette has been enhanced to make it easier to navigate. Steps can be added without specifying properties. Properties can be added later.</li>
<li>The new Auto Layout feature automatically lays out the diagram when you drop steps into the diagram.</li>
<li>Scripts on a step can be open from the property dialog, using the Script Editor. The editor provides syntax coloring and a search and replace feature. Layouts from earlier UrbanCode Deploy versions can be convert into the new process layout. You can revert to the original layout if desired.</li>
<h2>New integration with VRealize Automation</h2>
<li>
The UrbanCode Deploy Blueprint Designer now provides integration with VRealize Automation (vRA). You can create a cloud blueprint in UrbanCode Deploy that incorporates vCenter IaaS constructs managed through vRA, including virtual machine templates and network profiles. Additionally, you can add vRA software components and UrbanCode Deploy software components to create a full stack blueprint that can be executed through UrbanCode Deploy to create and deploy a vRA blueprint. Then, you can manage the created resources from vRA in UrbanCode Deploy to view environment status and delete the environment in vRA when it is no longer needed.
</li>
<li>
The key benefits of using UrbanCode Deploy with vRA is that the combination of using UrbanCode Deploy for the deployment automation and VRA to manage the infrastructure. UrbanCode Deploy also allows VMware users to seamlessly move their vRA/vCenter blueprints to other cloud providers, including OpenStack, SoftLayer, and others.
</li>
<h2>Improved support for middleware deployments and configuration management</h2>
<li>
The Deploy, Configure, and Install WebSphere Application Server plug-ins have been updated to include the ability to migrate captured configurations to a new version of WebSphere Application Server.</li>
<li>Support for WebSphere Liberty Collectives has been added to the UrbanCode Deploy IBM WebSphere Liberty plug-in.
</li>
<h2>Enhancements to full stack provisioning</h2>
<li>Application processes can now be run from an UrbanCode Deploy cloud blueprint to provision Windows or Linux VMs on multiple clouds (Softlayer, AWS, Azure).</li>
<h2>Monitor key deployment metrics</h2>
<li>The ability to monitor key deployment metrics through integration with applications such as New Relic and IBM Application Performance Management has been added. This includes key metrics that cover agents, individual components and applications, as well as component summary metrics.
</li>
