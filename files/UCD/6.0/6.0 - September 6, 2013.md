IBM UrbanCode Release 6.0 delivers new capabilities to further enable enterprise level release planning and execution.




Continuous Delivery Spanning Multiple Applications

* Automatically promote and deploy changes that pass the defined quality criteria and entry requirements for downstream environments
* Schedule deployment windows to configure when changes to the environment can be made






Rational Team Concert Integration

* View user stories and defects as IBM UrbanCode Release aggregates data across multiple tools to provide a high-level view of development work
* Know what work items are intended to be shipped for a given business project to help build an end to end view of the release






Release Status View

* View overdue milestones or tasks on the release process checklist
* Easily identify how many user stories are in progress, complete, verified or resolved to view the status of the development and testing effort






Enhanced team-based security settings

* Limit the changes that individuals in one business unit can make to releases that belong in another business unit by associating applications and environments to particular teams
* Filtering items that only matter for your particular content as a user
