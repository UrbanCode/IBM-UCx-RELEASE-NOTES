For information on documentation and support resources, software and hardware requirements and installation steps, see the [Getting Started](../getting-started) page. 



Behavioral Changes
 Upgrading from 6.0
-------------------


UrbanCode Deploy 6.1 introduced scalability enhancements to agent/server communication. All agent relays must be upgraded before running any deployments. All existing agents will continue to work without an upgrade, but they should be upgraded using the Upgrade action on the agent list in the web UI as soon as possible after upgrading. Any newly installed agents must be version 6.1. The latest agent and agent relay installers will be available on your UrbanCode Deploy server’s Tools page (in the Help menu) after the server is upgraded.


UrbanCode Deploy 6.1 also includes a more scalable artifact storage system. After upgrading your server, a background process will migrate artifacts into the new format. You can continue to access and deploy artifacts during this process, but there will need to be at least as much free disk space in the server’s var/repository directory as is currently being used by that directory. (If you currently have 25GB of artifacts, you need 25GB of additional free disk space.) The extra disk space is no longer needed after all artifacts have been migrated.


 Workflow changes
-----------------


This release includes some changes to how workflows are processed. The goal of these changes was to address what had been an outstanding defect for several years. In this scenario:


[![Screen Shot 2014-08-27 at 5.55.55 PM](Screen-Shot-2014-08-27-at-5.55.55-PM.png)](Screen-Shot-2014-08-27-at-5.55.55-PM.png)


You’d expect that only when both branches (Step A/B and C/D) finish successfully, StepE runs. But in fact, if one branch fails, StepE would still run when the second branch finishes. For example, if StepA and B pass but StepC fails, StepE will still run after StepB. To fix this, in 6.1.0.2, if any part of a branch becomes invalid, the entire branch is considered invalid, and if there’s some place in the workflow where the branch joins with another branch, it won’t go past there unless all of both branches have actually passed.


A consequence of that change is that joining behavior becomes more strict. In order to minimize impact on existing configuration, we’ve also added detection of “mutually exclusive” branches – when you go on one branch if a step fails, and another if it succeeds. Since there is no condition where both of these branches will be run, we need to only require one of them to come through.


[![Screen Shot 2014-08-27 at 6.01.30 PM](Screen-Shot-2014-08-27-at-6.01.30-PM.png)](Screen-Shot-2014-08-27-at-6.01.30-PM.png)


In the above scenario, StepE will run as long as one of the two branches leading into it have successfully executed. We detect conditions like this by examining both branches and finding the step where they separated (StepZ, in this case). If the arrows leading out of that step are mutually exclusive (at least one “On Success” and at least one “On Failure”), we will only require one of the branches to have passed before we execute the step which joins them.


There is currently a limitation to this behavior, though. In cases where branches are created in multiple locations but join at the same step, the new logic will only find the first point at which the branches were created. Consider the following:


[![Screen Shot 2014-08-27 at 6.06.41 PM](Screen-Shot-2014-08-27-at-6.06.41-PM.png)](Screen-Shot-2014-08-27-at-6.06.41-PM.png)


Step D and Step X/Y are mutually exclusive, but they join with a third branch (Step A/B) which was created higher in the workflow. The server will see StepZ as the point where branches were created, and since its outgoing arrows are not mutually exclusive, it will require all three branches to have passed before executing StepE. This will never happen, so the workflow will fail.


Additional enhancements to this logic are planned so that the server will be able to detect multiple branching points more accurately, but until that becomes available, the workaround is to add an intermediate step to join each set of mutually exclusive branches. In our scenario here, adding StepW will do the trick:


[![Screen Shot 2014-08-27 at 6.13.08 PM](Screen-Shot-2014-08-27-at-6.13.08-PM.png)](Screen-Shot-2014-08-27-at-6.13.08-PM.png)


Because StepW connects these two branches without being affected by the outcome of the branch with Step A/B, it will properly detect that they are mutually exclusive. The step used here can be any step other than the explicit “Join” step, as the “Join” step requires all incoming paths to be valid every time. In this case, StepW is a shell plugin which simply runs “ls”.

Plan & Prepare
For fixes contained in this release, and any known issues, review the [release notes](../release-notes).


For supported platforms and requirements, see the [system requirements](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038801). Note that some supported plug-ins have system requirements that vary from the core product. Information on system requirements for individual plug-ins is available on the download page for that plug-in.


To get started quickly to try the software, IBM UrbanCode Deploy is shipped with an Apache Derby database. Apache Derby deployments are not supported for production environments. As you plan your production topology, review the [installation guide](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/urbancode-deploy/7.2.3?topic=installing)


For advanced enterprise deployments that require high availability, review our options in the [information center.](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS4GSP_6.1.0)


IBM UrbanCode Deploy supports integrations with many different tools available from both IBM as well as other vendors in the form of component process steps. Each IBM UrbanCode Deploy plug-in is a separate download and installation available on our [plug-in page](https://urbancode.github.io/IBM-UCx-PLUGIN-DOCS/UCD).





If you’re upgrading from 6.0…
UrbanCode Deploy 6.1 introduced scalability enhancements to agent/server communication. **All agent relays must be upgraded before running any deployments.** All existing agents will continue to work without an upgrade, but they should be upgraded using the Upgrade action on the agent list in the web UI as soon as possible after upgrading. **Any newly installed agents must be version 6.1.** The latest agent and agent relay installers will be available on your UrbanCode Deploy server’s Tools page (in the Help menu) after the server is upgraded.


UrbanCode Deploy 6.1 also includes a more scalable artifact storage system. After upgrading your server, a background process will migrate artifacts into the new format. You can continue to access and deploy artifacts during this process, but **there will need to be at least as much free disk space in the server’s var/repository directory as is currently being used by that directory**. (If you currently have 25GB of artifacts, you need 25GB of additional free disk space.) The extra disk space is no longer needed after all artifacts have been migrated.
