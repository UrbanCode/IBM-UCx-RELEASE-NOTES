<h2>Configurable Default Team Membership</h2>
<p>
The default team membership for objects you create can be controlled from your user profile. You can set the default to be all the teams to which you belong, none of the teams, or a specific set of teams you choose. If you are in a role that allows team management, you can choose from all teams in the system. Otherwise, you can choose from among the teams to which you belong.
