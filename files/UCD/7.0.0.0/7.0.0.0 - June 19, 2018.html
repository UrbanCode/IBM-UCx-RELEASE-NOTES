<h2>Scale Without Boundary</h2>
UrbanCode Deploy 7.0 has new server/agent communication technology that has been tested to support up to 100,000 online agents, which is about a 10x increase over prior versions! This new communication technology is based on websockets and will be the default setting for new installations. Customers upgrading from prior versions will need to opt-in to this capability.

<h2>New integration with CyberArk</h2>
UCD 7.0 makes it easy to use CyberArk Application Identity Manager, part of the CyberArk Privileged Account Security Solution, in your deployment processes.
