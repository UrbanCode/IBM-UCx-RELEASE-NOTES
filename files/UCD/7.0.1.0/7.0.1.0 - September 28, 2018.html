<p><h3>Mass Enablement for New Server/Agent Communication</h3>
UrbanCode Deploy 7.0 introduced a new server/agent communication protocol which offers users many performance improvements, and increased scalability. UrbanCode Deploy 7.0.1.0 is extending this capability by adding Agent Configuration Templates which will allow users to define a reusable set of configuration that can be used to easily migrate existing JMS agents to WEB agents.
<h3>Mixed Mode Licensing</h3>
