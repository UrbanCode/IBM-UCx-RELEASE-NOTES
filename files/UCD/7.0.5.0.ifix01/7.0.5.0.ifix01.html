<p><h2>New features</h2>
The following are new features added in this release.
<h3>Compression of Versioned Configuration Records</h3>
New entries to vc_persistent_record will store a compressed CLOB which will reduce the growth of that table significantly.
<h3>Codestation S3 Support</h3>
Artifacts can now be stored inside an S3 bucket. After configured, all artifact creation and modification occurs inside the S3 bucket and not on the filesystem. Existing codestation repositories can be migrated to an S3 bucket using the S3 Migrator Tool available from the UrbanCode Deploy server Tools page.
<h3>Ordering Properties</h3>
Properties and property definitions can now be re-ordered and sorted based on their given index. Drag and drop using the :: icon to place the property at its desired position.
<h3>Snapshot Changes Tab</h3>
UrbanCode Deploy snapshots now have a <strong>Changes</strong> tab which tracks version additions and removals for a specific snapshot.
<h3>Table Display Customization</h3>
Many tables now contain a <strong>Customize Display</strong> button that allows you to show, hide, and re-order columns within the table.
