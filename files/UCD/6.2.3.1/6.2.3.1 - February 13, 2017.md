**Important**


If you are upgrading from version 6.2.3.0 and earlier, servers and relays must be upgraded at the same time. Agents connected through relays may not connect successfully until both server and relay are upgraded. This is due to an incompatibility between versions of an library used by UCD. 



Beginning in version 6.2.2, the IBM UrbanCode Deploy server and agent relays require a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8. If you are updating or changing the JRE to the latest version, see 
[Changing or updating the JRE of servers](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS4GSP_6.2.3/com.ibm.udeploy.doc/topics/jre_change.html#jre_change) and [Updating the JRE location for agent relays](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS4GSP_6.2.3/com.ibm.udeploy.doc/topics/update_JRE_agent_relays.html#update_JRE_agent_relays) for instructions. For documentation on the IBM JRE, see [IBM SDK, Java Technology Edition](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2/welcome_javasdk_family.html).



If you are upgrading from version 6.2.1.0 or earlier, to ensure that all secure property values are obscured, the values of all properties in the history for existing deployments are obscured. In the deployment history for deployments that you run after you upgrade, only secure properties are obscured in the logs.
