New keystore property
---------------------


A new property identifying the keystore alias has been added to the `server.xml` file. The default for this property is **server**. If the keystore is not using **server** as the alias, change the value for the **tomcat.key.alias** property to the alias being used in the `installed.properties` file. Otherwise, a failure occurs with starting UrbanCode Deploy after an upgrade.
