<p><div class="new_release_cont">This release of IBM UrbanCode Deploy is a maintenance release and includes the following features as well as various bug fixes and performance enhancements. This release is recommended for all customers.</div>
<div class="new_release_cont">
<h2>UrbanCode Deploy with Patterns Support<br/>
</h2>
<p>Version 6.1.0.1 includes a built-in integration with the pattern designer for UrbanCode Deploy with Patterns, so that users in the core UrbanCode Deploy product can request new environments to be provisioned through the pattern designer directly from the application environment list.
</p>
</div>
<div class="new_release_cont">
<h2>Enhanced snapshot locking control<br/>
</h2>
<p>Environments can be configured to specifically lock either snapshot versions or snapshot configuration, or both, when snapshots are deployed to the environment. In addition, users can now manually lock snapshots so that they cannot be changed in the future, and there are new CLI calls available to initiate this.
</p>
</div>
<div class="new_release_cont">
<h2>Agent backwards compatibility and enhanced status tracking<br/>
</h2>
<p>Unlike version 6.1.0.0, version 6.1.0.1 can continue to use pre-6.x agents, all the way back to agents from version 4.8.5. In addition, agents which should be upgraded are indicated as such in the UI, with a new indicator to show the minimum required and recommended agent versions.
