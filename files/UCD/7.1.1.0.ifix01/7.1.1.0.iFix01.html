<h2>7.1.1.0</h2>
Version 7.1.1.0 release is a maintenance release and includes the following bug fixes and enhancements. 

<h3>Key Features and Enhancements</h3>
<dl>
 	<dt>Processes as code</dt>
 	<dd>Application and component processes can now be modeled in the new custom Process as Code (PAC) format.

You can use the bundled Process-as-Code Compiler to convert existing processes into the PAC format and then modify them using your text editor. The modified PAC files can then be translated and uploaded back into the server for use in your deployments.

The PAC utility, which includes a detailed guide to the new syntax, can be downloaded from the dashboard. Click <strong>Help</strong> > <strong>Tools</strong> > <strong>Process-as-code Compiler</strong> to download.
