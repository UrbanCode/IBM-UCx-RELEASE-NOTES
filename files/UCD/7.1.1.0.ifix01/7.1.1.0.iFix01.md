7.1.1.0
-------


Version 7.1.1.0 release is a maintenance release and includes the following bug fixes and enhancements. 

### Key Features and Enhancements



Processes as code
Application and component processes can now be modeled in the new custom Process as Code (PAC) format.

You can use the bundled Process-as-Code Compiler to convert existing processes into the PAC format and then modify them using your text editor. The modified PAC files can then be translated and uploaded back into the server for use in your deployments.

The PAC utility, which includes a detailed guide to the new syntax, can be downloaded from the dashboard. Click **Help** > **Tools** > **Process-as-code Compiler** to download.



Tag management
The **Settings** tab now includes a Tag page that facilitates central management of all tags that have been created on the UrbanCode Deploy server. Users with the new **Manage Tags** permission can edit the name, color, and description of existing tags. When a tag is modified from the Tag page it is modified on all objects that are tagged with the tag.
Email approvals
Users who are assigned to an approval task can follow a URL in the email notification they receive to approve the task. The URL links to a mobile responsive page that allows the user to only review, and approve or reject the specified task.
CLI enhancements
This release continues the extension of the CLI API began in previous releases. Several actions that previously could only be done in the web UI can now be done using the API. These actions includes activities like importing and exporting objects, deleting objects, and removing users from roles.
**Redesign of the Get Started page**
The revised Get Started page can now be accessed from the **Help** menu or by clicking the UrbanCode Deploy segment of the navigation bar. This page includes quick links to documentation, tutorials, release notes, and more.
**License usage improvements**
License configuration has moved from the System Settings view into a new License Management page. The new License Management page is where the license server connection and automatic agent license type can be configured. After a connection is made, information is displayed about the available licenses and license consumption.
