     Agent Compatibility Note
    </div>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Agents used to import new component versions will need to be upgraded to agent version 6.1.0.4. If older agents are used, version import tasks will fail with the following error:
      <pre>Exception in thread "main" java/nio/charset/IllegalCharsetNameException: ${DS_SYSTEM_ENCODING}</pre>
     </li>
     <li>
      Due to changes in communication, if you leverage the integration with the Rational Team Concert build, you must first upgrade your RTC server to 5.0.2.

     Agent Status Tracking Improvements
    </div>
    <p>
     This release improves agent status tracking for agents connection through agent relays and in HA environments. For best results, it is necessary to upgrade agent relays. Without these upgrades, agent status tracking for agents connected through relays is unreliable.

     If you’re upgrading from 6.0…
    </div>
    <p>
     UrbanCode Deploy 6.1 introduced scalability enhancements to agent/server communication.
     <strong>
      All agent relays must be upgraded before running any deployments.
     </strong>
     All existing agents will continue to work without an upgrade, but they should be upgraded using the Upgrade action on the agent list in the web UI as soon as possible after upgrading.
     <strong>
      Any newly installed agents must be version 6.1.
     </strong>
     The latest agent and agent relay installers will be available on your UrbanCode Deploy server’s Tools page (in the Help menu) after the server is upgraded.
    </p>
    <p>
     UrbanCode Deploy 6.1 also includes a more scalable artifact storage system. After upgrading your server, a background process will migrate artifacts into the new format. You can continue to access and deploy artifacts during this process, but
     <strong>
      there will need to be at least as much free disk space in the server’s var/repository directory as is currently being used by that directory
     </strong>
     . (If you currently have 25GB of artifacts, you need 25GB of additional free disk space.) The extra disk space is no longer needed after all artifacts have been migrated.
