6.2.1.1 - May 26, 2016
======================




**IMPORTANT** UCD 6.2.1.1 does not support upgrades when using DB2 on a z/OS server. Attempting to upgrade using this fixpack will display an error message and the upgrade will not occur. Do not upgrade to the 6.2.1.1 fixpack if you use DB2 on z/OS. A fix will be provided in UCD 6.2.1.2.




New Azure Image Provisioning
----------------------------

* You can now provision Linux images to Microsoft Azure whether or not those images have  

 the `cloud-init` package installed.
* You can now use Windows images on Azure. See [Modeling environments for Microsoft Azure](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS4GSP_6.2.1/com.ibm.edt.doc/topics/blueprint_edit_azure.html "To model a Microsoft Azure environment, log in with an Azure cloud project and specify the Azure-specific information in a blueprint.").





Deployment history cleanup
--------------------------


You can now configure environments so that process history from that environment is deleted after a certain number of days. Deployment history deletion can decrease the size requirements of both the database and the server’s filesystem. See [Cleaning up deployment history files.](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/urbancode-deploy/7.2.3?topic=deploying-cleaning-up-deployment-history-files) 




Stronger Approvals
------------------



Can now require that the requester and approver cannot be the same user. A checkbox labeled “No Self-Approvals” is present on each environment or environment template requiring approvals. If an environment is using an environment template then the environment will inherit the setting.


For example, user A requests an application process on an environment where this is enabled: User A does not get a notification that approvals are waiting on him/her, cannot see the approval present in his/her work items tab, and cannot respond to the approval request.





Silent Install Relay
--------------------



Run the agent relay installation silently and store configuration in an properties file! See [Installing agent relays in silent mode.](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS4GSP_6.2.1/com.ibm.udeploy.install.doc/topics/install_agentrelay_silent.html)
