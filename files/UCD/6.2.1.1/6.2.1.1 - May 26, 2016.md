6.2.1.1

**This article was originaly published in 2016.05.26**


6.2.1.1 - May 26, 2016
======================




**IMPORTANT** UCD 6.2.1.1 does not support upgrades when using DB2 on a z/OS server. Attempting to upgrade using this fixpack will display an error message and the upgrade will not occur. Do not upgrade to the 6.2.1.1 fixpack if you use DB2 on z/OS. A fix will be provided in UCD 6.2.1.2.




New Azure Image Provisioning
----------------------------

* You can now provision Linux images to Microsoft Azure whether or not those images have  

 the `cloud-init` package installed.
* You can now use Windows images on Azure. See [Modeling environments for Microsoft Azure](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS4GSP_6.2.1/com.ibm.edt.doc/topics/blueprint_edit_azure.html "To model a Microsoft Azure environment, log in with an Azure cloud project and specify the Azure-specific information in a blueprint.").





Deployment history cleanup
--------------------------


You can now configure environments so that process history from that environment is deleted after a certain number of days. Deployment history deletion can decrease the size requirements of both the database and the server’s filesystem. See [Cleaning up deployment history files.](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/urbancode-deploy/7.2.3?topic=deploying-cleaning-up-deployment-history-files) 




Stronger Approvals
------------------



Can now require that the requester and approver cannot be the same user. A checkbox labeled “No Self-Approvals” is present on each environment or environment template requiring approvals. If an environment is using an environment template then the environment will inherit the setting.


For example, user A requests an application process on an environment where this is enabled: User A does not get a notification that approvals are waiting on him/her, cannot see the approval present in his/her work items tab, and cannot respond to the approval request.





Silent Install Relay
--------------------



Run the agent relay installation silently and store configuration in an properties file! See [Installing agent relays in silent mode.](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS4GSP_6.2.1/com.ibm.udeploy.install.doc/topics/install_agentrelay_silent.html)

Getting Started
---------------

  

Plan & Prepare
**IMPORTANT** UCD 6.2.1.1 does not support upgrades when using DB2 on a z/OS server. Attempting to upgrade using this fixpack will display an error message and the upgrade will not occur. Do not upgrade to the 6.2.1.1 fixpack if you use DB2 on z/OS. A fix will be provided in UCD 6.2.1.2.


**IMPORTANT** Please set the com.urbancode.ds.cleanup.sourceConfig.fullCleanupSkip to true to retain source config execution records at upgrade time.


**IMPORTANT** If you are upgrading to version 6.2.1.1 or later, to ensure that all secure property values are obscured, the values of all properties in the history for existing deployments are obscured. In the deployment history for deployments that you run after you upgrade, only secure properties are obscured in the logs.


For fixes contained in this release, and any known issues, review the [release notes](../release-notes).


For supported platforms and requirements, see the [system requirements](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038801). Note that some supported plug-ins have system requirements that vary from the core product. Information on system requirements for individual plug-ins is available on the download page for that plug-in.


To get started quickly to try the software, IBM UrbanCode Deploy is shipped with an Apache Derby database. Apache Derby deployments are not supported for production environments. As you plan your production topology, review the [installation guide](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS4GSP_6.2.1/com.ibm.udeploy.install.doc/topics/install_ch.html)


For advanced enterprise deployments that require high availability, review our options in the [information center.](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS4GSP_6.2.1)


IBM UrbanCode Deploy supports integrations with many different tools available from both IBM as well as other vendors in the form of component process steps. Each IBM UrbanCode Deploy plug-in is a separate download and installation available on our [plug-in page](https://urbancode.github.io/IBM-UCx-PLUGIN-DOCS/UCD).





If you’re upgrading from 6.0…
UrbanCode Deploy 6.1 introduced scalability enhancements to agent/server communication. **All agent relays must be upgraded before running any deployments.** All existing agents will continue to work without an upgrade, but they should be upgraded using the Upgrade action on the agent list in the web UI as soon as possible after upgrading. **Any newly installed agents must be version 6.1.** The latest agent and agent relay installers will be available on your UrbanCode Deploy server’s Tools page (in the Help menu) after the server is upgraded.


UrbanCode Deploy 6.1 also includes a more scalable artifact storage system. After upgrading your server, a background process will migrate artifacts into the new format. You can continue to access and deploy artifacts during this process, but **there will need to be at least as much free disk space in the server’s var/repository directory as is currently being used by that directory**. (If you currently have 25GB of artifacts, you need 25GB of additional free disk space.) The extra disk space is no longer needed after all artifacts have been migrated.
