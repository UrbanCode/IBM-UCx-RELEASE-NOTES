<h2>New Azure Image Provisioning</h2>
<li>You can now provision Linux images to Microsoft Azure whether or not those images have<br/>
          the <samp class="ph codeph">cloud-init</samp> package installed.</li>
<li>You can now use Windows images on Azure. See <a class="xref" href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS4GSP_6.2.1/com.ibm.edt.doc/topics/blueprint_edit_azure.html" target="_blank" title="To model a Microsoft Azure environment, log in with an Azure cloud project and specify the Azure-specific information in a blueprint." rel="noopener noreferrer">Modeling environments for Microsoft Azure</a>.</li>

<h2>Deployment history cleanup</h2>
<p>You can now configure environments so that process history from that environment is deleted after a certain number of days. Deployment history deletion can decrease the size requirements of both the database and the server’s filesystem. See <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/urbancode-deploy/7.2.3?topic=deploying-cleaning-up-deployment-history-files" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cleaning up deployment history files.</a> </p>

<h2>Stronger Approvals</h2>
<p>
Can now require that the requester and approver cannot be the same user. A checkbox labeled “No Self-Approvals” is present on each environment or environment template requiring approvals. If an environment is using an environment template then the environment will inherit the setting.</p>
<p>For example, user A requests an application process on an environment where this is enabled: User A does not get a notification that approvals are waiting on him/her, cannot see the approval present in his/her work items tab, and cannot respond to the approval request.
