<p><h3>Secured Authentication Tokens</h3>
Users can restrict the authentication tokens used by process steps so that only tokens with the minimum permissions needed to accomplish the step are created. Also, authentication tokens are now encrypted in storage, and existing tokens can be updated to the new encryption standard.
<h3>Increased Detail in Audit Logging</h3>
The audit log now specifies whether the user used an authentication token to log in and more detail about the security settings that were changed.
<h3>Additional Permissions Added</h3>
Specific permissions have been added to upgrade and delete agents, delete agent relays, and edit post processing scripts.
<h3>Optional Manual Task Notifications</h3>
Choose notification options for manual tasks including no notification. You can restrict approvals for manual task to the person who started the deployment.
<h3>Full z/OS Component Versions</h3>
Components using z/OS now have the option to use full or incremental versions.
