   <h3>
    Secured Authentication Tokens
   </h3>
   Users can restrict the authentication tokens used by process steps so that only tokens with the minimum permissions needed to accomplish the step are created. Also, authentication tokens are now encrypted in storage, and existing tokens can be updated to the new encryption standard.
   <h3>
    Increased Detail in Audit Logging
   </h3>
   The audit log now specifies whether the user used an authentication token to log in and more detail about the security settings that were changed.
   <h3>
    Additional Permissions Added
   </h3>
   Specific permissions have been added to upgrade and delete agents, delete agent relays, and edit post processing scripts.
   <h3>
    Optional Manual Task Notifications
   </h3>
   Choose notification options for manual tasks including no notification. You can restrict approvals for manual task to the person who started the deployment.
   <h3>
    Full z/OS Component Versions
   </h3>
   Components using z/OS now have the option to use full or incremental versions.
   <h3>
    Terraform
   </h3>
   Greater support for creating Terraform documents in the blueprint designer. The blueprint designer now combines different provider syntaxes into one, unified graphical representation.

Enhancements to the Terraform extensions (provider, provisioner) for IBM UrbanCode Deploy.

    Upgrade Notes
   </h3>

   </div>
   <h3>
    Starting in 6.2.5.2
   </h3>
   Starting the server for the first time may take longer than usual. For very large installations, allow an extra hour for the first server startup. Subsequent startups will take the regular amount of time.

Users now do not receive notifications based on their membership in a role on the System Team. Users will have to be added to the correct role on a different team as well to receive notifications.

The server now deletes all contents of the var/temp directory on server startup.
   <h3>
    Starting in 6.2.5.1
   </h3>
   Process requests from deleted environments will now be deleted. To keep process requests from deleted environments, add this property to the installed.properties file: com.urbancode.ds.cleanup.HistoryCleanup.disableDeletedEnvironmentCleanup=true
   <h3>
    Starting in 6.2.5.0
   </h3>
   The UCD_SESSION_KEY header has been renamed to UCD_CSRF_TOKEN. The previous name is also accepted until 6.3 when it will be removed from the product.

Users now require the “Execute” permission on agents in order to run processes against them. All existing user roles will receive this permission when upgrading from a version before 6.2.5.0. When upgrading, ensure that any user that needs to execute processes is on the same team as the agents required to run those processes.
   <h3>
    Starting in 6.2.4.0
   </h3>
   You must upgrade Agent Relays when upgrading from a version below 6.2.4.0. Also, the TLS protocol 3DES is no longer supported.

After upgrading from before 6.2.4.0, users will not be able to view or delete agent relays until they have been granted permission to those relays. Relays that existed before the upgrade are only added to the System Team by default. For users to view agent relays, a user with Manage Security permission should give the correct roles the new For relays that existed before the upgrade, a user with Manage Security permissions will have to add the agent relays to the correct teams and give the correct roles the Agent Relay view and edit permissions.

When upgrading an IBM UrbanCode Deploy agent, end-to-end JMS encryption will automatically be enabled on all agents. In order for agent communication to function properly with end-to-end encryption enabled, the IBM UrbanCode Deploy server and agent clocks need to be synchronized to within a few minutes. To disable this feature, add the line
   <code>
    agent.jms.disable_full_encryption=true
   </code>
   ” to the agent’s
   <code>
    conf/agent/installed.properties
   </code>
   file before upgrading the agent.
   <h3>
    Starting in 6.2.3.0
   </h3>
   If you are upgrading from version 6.2.3.0 and earlier, servers and relays must be upgraded at the same time. Agents connected through relays may not connect successfully until both server and relay are upgraded. This is due to an incompatibility between versions of an library used by UCD.

Starting in 6.2.3.0, authentication tokens will be obfuscated in the UI and REST API after their initial creation. Scripts and users will only be able to retrieve the full authentication token immediately after creating it.

The silent install of the IBM UrbanCode Deploy server hangs when prompting for the value of the server installation directory (
   <code>
    install.server.dir
   </code>
   ). To workaround the problem, run the following instead of calling
   <code>
    ./install-server.sh
   </code>
   directly:
   <code>
    echo "" &gt; answerFile.txt echo "" &gt;&gt; answerFile.txt ./install-server.sh &lt; answerFile.txt (or install-server.bat &lt; answerFile.txt for Windows installations)
   </code>
   <h3>
    Starting in 6.2.2.0
   </h3>
   The IBM UrbanCode Deploy server and agent relays now require a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8. If you are updating or changing the JRE to the latest version, see

   To ensure that all secure property values are obscured, the values of all properties in the history for existing deployments are obscured. In the deployment history for deployments that you run after you upgrade, only secure properties are obscured in the logs.

New security features erase old component version import logs to hide secure information. If you want to keep the logs, in the installed.properties file, set the
   <strong>
    com.urbancode.ds.cleanup.sourceConfig.fullCleanupSkip
