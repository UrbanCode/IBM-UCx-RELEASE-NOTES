Getting Started
---------------

  
**Important**
The UCD\_SESSION\_KEY header has been renamed to UCD\_CSRF\_TOKEN. The previous name is also accepted until 6.3 when it will be removed from the product.


Starting in 6.2.5.0, users require the “Execute” permission on agents in order to run processes against them. All existing user roles will receive this permission when upgrading from a version before 6.2.5.0. When upgrading, ensure that any user that needs to execute processes is on the same team as the agents required to run those processes.


After upgrading from a version before 6.2.5.2 to 6.2.5.2 or later, starting the server for the first time may take longer than usual. For very large installations, allow an extra half hour for the first server startup. Subsequent startups will take the regular amount of time.


Starting in 6.2.5.2, users do not receive notifications based on their membership in a role on the System Team. Users will have to be added to the correct role on a different team as well to receive notifications.


Starting in 6.2.5.2, the server deletes all contents of the var/temp directory on server startup.


For any upgrade to a version at or beyond 6.2.5.1, process requests from deleted environments will be deleted. To keep process requests from deleted environments, add this property to the installed.properties file: com.urbancode.ds.cleanup.HistoryCleanup.disableDeletedEnvironmentCleanup=true


When upgrading from UrbanCode Deploy 6.2.4.0 and earlier you must upgrade Agent Relays and the TLS protocol 3DES is no longer supported.


If you are upgrading from version 6.2.3.0 and earlier, servers and relays must be upgraded at the same time. Agents connected through relays may not connect successfully until both server and relay are upgraded. This is due to an incompatibility between versions of an library used by UCD. 


Beginning in version 6.2.2, the IBM UrbanCode Deploy server and agent relays require a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8. If you are updating or changing the JRE to the latest version, see  



If you are upgrading from version 6.2.1.0 or earlier, to ensure that all secure property values are obscured, the values of all properties in the history for existing deployments are obscured. In the deployment history for deployments that you run after you upgrade, only secure properties are obscured in the logs.


If you are upgrading from version 6.2.1.0 or earlier, new security features erase old component version import logs to hide secure information. If you want to keep the logs, in the installed.properties file, set the **com.urbancode.ds.cleanup.sourceConfig.fullCleanupSkip** property to **true**.


When upgrading an IBM UrbanCode Deploy agent to 6.2.3.1, end-to-end JMS encryption will automatically be enabled on all agents. In order for agent communication to function properly with end-to-end encryption enabled, the IBM UrbanCode Deploy server and agent clocks need to be synchronized to within a few minutes. To disable this feature, add the line `agent.jms.disable_full_encryption=true`” to the agent’s `conf/agent/installed.properties` file before upgrading the agent.


After upgrading to IBM UrbanCode Deploy 6.2.3.1, users will not be able to view or delete agent relays until they have been granted permission to those relays. Relays that existed before the upgrade are only added to the System Team by default. For users to view agent relays, a user with Manage Security permission should give the correct roles the new For relays that existed before the upgrade, a user with Manage Security permissions will have to add the agent relays to the correct teams and give the correct roles the Agent Relay view and edit permissions.


The silent install of the IBM UrbanCode Deploy 6.2.3.1 server hangs when prompting for the value of the server installation directory (`install.server.dir`). To workaround the problem, run the following instead of calling `./install-server.sh` directly:  



useJmx has been enabled and createConnector disabled has been added to activemq.xml on Agent Relays.


Starting in 6.2.3.0, authentication tokens will be obfuscated in the UI and REST API after their initial creation. Scripts and users will only be able to retrieve the full authentication token immediately after creating it.



Plan & Prepare

For supported platforms and requirements, see the [system requirements](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038801). Note that some supported plug-ins have system requirements that vary from the core product. Information on system requirements for individual plug-ins is available on the download page for that plug-in.  

To get started quickly to try the software, IBM UrbanCode Deploy is shipped with an Apache Derby database. Apache Derby deployments are not supported for production environments. As you plan your production topology, review the [installation guide](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS4GSP_6.2.6/com.ibm.udeploy.install.doc/topics/install_ch.html).  

For advanced enterprise deployments that require high availability, review our options in the [information center.](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS4GSP_6.2.6)  

IBM UrbanCode Deploy supports integrations with many different tools available from both IBM as well as other vendors in the form of component process steps. Each IBM UrbanCode Deploy plug-in is a separate download and installation available on our [plug-in page](https://urbancode.github.io/IBM-UCx-PLUGIN-DOCS/UCD).
