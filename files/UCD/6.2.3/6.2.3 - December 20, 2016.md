6.2.3 - December 20, 2016
=========================




IBM® UrbanCode™ Deploy 6.2.3 is a maintenance release and includes various bug fixes and performance enhancements. This release is recommended for all customers.





New Getting Started wizard
--------------------------


A new wizard is available to assist with the basic concepts of deployment automation and how to implement a deployment within approximately 30 minutes. The new Automation Engineer role is available with all the appropriate permissions needed to use the wizard.


The wizard is immediately available for new installations. If performing an upgrade, you must add the following name/value pair to the `installed.properties` file on the server for the wizard to be available:  

`server.enable.welcome.tab=true`


New filters available for the Deployment Detail Report
------------------------------------------------------


You can select a specific component or component version when creating a Deployment Detail Report.


Admin Auth token no longer used for automated tasks
---------------------------------------------------


You no longer need to use Admin Auth tokens for the version import, auto discovery or autoconfigure tasks. Removing this requirement eliminates the need for these tokens which have been replaced by three new default roles and users instead of the Admin Auth token.


Plug-in updates
---------------


The Docker plug-ins provide a streamline deployment and management of containerized applications. Three new templates are available with the plug-ins to define a consistent deployment process for each application environment. 


Tomcat upgrade
--------------


In this version, the internal Apache Tomcat server has been upgraded to version 8.5.8 for improved security.

Getting Started
---------------

  

IMPORTANT
Beginning in version 6.2.2, the IBM UrbanCode Deploy server and agent relays require a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8. If you are updating or changing the JRE to the latest version, see  



If you are upgrading from version 6.2.1.0 or earlier, to ensure that all secure property values are obscured, the values of all properties in the history for existing deployments are obscured. In the deployment history for deployments that you run after you upgrade, only secure properties are obscured in the logs.


If you are upgrading from version 6.2.1.0 or earlier, new security features erase old component version import logs to hide secure information. If you want to keep the logs, in the installed.properties file, set the **com.urbancode.ds.cleanup.sourceConfig.fullCleanupSkip** property to **True**.


When upgrading an IBM UrbanCode Deploy agent to 6.2.3, end-to-end JMS encryption will automatically be enabled on all agents. In order for agent communication to function properly with end-to-end encryption enabled, the IBM UrbanCode Deploy server and agent clocks need to be synchronized to within a few minutes. To disable this feature, add the line `agent.jms.disable_full_encryption=true`” to the agent’s `conf/agent/installed.properties` file before upgrading the agent.


After upgrading to IBM UrbanCode Deploy 6.2.3, users will not be able to view or delete agent relays until they have been granted permission to those relays. Relays that existed before the upgrade are only added to the System Team by default. For users to view agent relays, a user with Manage Security permission should give the correct roles the new For relays that existed before the upgrade, a user with Manage Security permissions will have to add the agent relays to the correct teams and give the correct roles the Agent Relay view and edit permissions.


The silent install of the IBM UrbanCode Deploy 6.2.3 server hangs when prompting for the value of the server installation directory (`install.server.dir`). To workaround the problem, run the following instead of calling `./install-server.sh` directly:


 `echo "" > answerFile.txt echo "" >> answerFile.txt ./install-server.sh < answerFile.txt (or install-server.bat < answerFile.txt for Windows installations)` 


Starting in 6.2.3.0, authentication tokens will be obfuscated in the UI and REST API after their initial creation. Scripts and users will only be able to retrieve the full authentication token immediately after creating it.




Plan & Prepare
