6.1.2 - July 31, 2015
=====================






IBM UrbanCode Deploy is a tool for automating application deployments through environments. It is designed to facilitate rapid feedback and continuous delivery in agile development while providing the audit trails, versioning and approvals needed in production.



UrbanCode Deploy provides

* Automated, consistent deployments and rollbacks of applications
* Orchestration of changes across servers, tiers and components
* Configuration and security differences across environments
* Clear visibility: what is deployed where and who changed what
* Integrated with middleware, provisioning and service virtualization




UrbanCode Deploy with Patterns delivers applications to the cloud, at scale, with speed and provides

* Rich web-based designer to create fullstack application blueprints for your cloud
* Continuous delivery pipeline environments for new applications
* Short-lived testing sandboxes for specific infrastructure combinations
* Infrastructure changes through environments just like application changes
* Consistency across environments, from testing to production even when using multiple clouds




Due to feedback from the market, both products will be available with the purchase of UrbanCode Deploy. As of release 6.1.2 of UrbanCode Deploy, the “patterns” engine and designer can be downloaded via Passport Advantage and installed optionally. Part number, pricing and licensing for UrbanCode Deploy will be the same as they were previously. UrbanCode Deploy with Patterns, will no longer be marketed.

For information on documentation and support resources, software and hardware requirements and installation steps, see the [Getting Started](../getting-started) page.





Agent Compatibility Note
* Agents used to import new component versions will need to be upgraded to agent version 6.1.0.4. If older agents are used, version import tasks will fail with the following error:

```
Exception in thread "main" java/nio/charset/IllegalCharsetNameException: ${DS\_SYSTEM\_ENCODING}
```
* Due to changes in communication, if you leverage the integration with the Rational Team Concert build, you must first upgrade your RTC server to 5.0.2.





Agent Status Tracking Improvements
This release improves agent status tracking for agents connection through agent relays and in HA environments. For best results, it is necessary to upgrade agent relays. Without these upgrades, agent status tracking for agents connected through relays is unreliable.





Behavioral Changes
This release contains an updated version of the File Utils plugin. If you use the Middleware Configuration for WebSphere Application Server plugin, please ensure you upgrade to version 8.141002 of the plugin.

Getting Started
---------------

  

Plan & Prepare
For fixes contained in this release, and any known issues, review the [release notes](../release-notes).


For supported platforms and requirements, see the [system requirements](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038801). Note that some supported plug-ins have system requirements that vary from the core product. Information on system requirements for individual plug-ins is available on the download page for that plug-in.


To get started quickly to try the software, IBM UrbanCode Deploy is shipped with an Apache Derby database. Apache Derby deployments are not supported for production environments. As you plan your production topology, review the [installation guide](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS4GSP_6.1.2/com.ibm.udeploy.install.doc/topics/install_ch.html)


For advanced enterprise deployments that require high availability, review our options in the [information center.](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS4GSP_6.1.2)


IBM UrbanCode Deploy supports integrations with many different tools available from both IBM as well as other vendors in the form of component process steps. Each IBM UrbanCode Deploy plug-in is a separate download and installation available on our [plug-in page](https://urbancode.github.io/IBM-UCx-PLUGIN-DOCS/UCD).





If you’re upgrading from 6.0…
UrbanCode Deploy 6.1 introduced scalability enhancements to agent/server communication. **All agent relays must be upgraded before running any deployments.** All existing agents will continue to work without an upgrade, but they should be upgraded using the Upgrade action on the agent list in the web UI as soon as possible after upgrading. **Any newly installed agents must be version 6.1.** The latest agent and agent relay installers will be available on your UrbanCode Deploy server’s Tools page (in the Help menu) after the server is upgraded.


UrbanCode Deploy 6.1 also includes a more scalable artifact storage system. After upgrading your server, a background process will migrate artifacts into the new format. You can continue to access and deploy artifacts during this process, but **there will need to be at least as much free disk space in the server’s var/repository directory as is currently being used by that directory**. (If you currently have 25GB of artifacts, you need 25GB of additional free disk space.) The extra disk space is no longer needed after all artifacts have been migrated.




Install the server
This release is available for download from Fix Central, requiring authentication. This download is [available here.](http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/quickorder?parent=ibm~Rational&product=ibm/Rational/IBM+UrbanCode+Deploy&release=6.1.1.0&platform=All&function=all&source=fc)


Information for installing the server, see the [Installing servers and agents](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS4GSP_6.1.2/com.ibm.udeploy.install.doc/topics/install_ch.html) section in the product documentation.
