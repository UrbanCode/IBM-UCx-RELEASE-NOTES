6.2 - October 29, 2015
======================





Application Templates
---------------------


Design once and reuse many times to enforce standards across an organization and facilitate the onboarding of new teams and applications


With this new feature, a centralized tool administrator can define and update application templates to enforce standards (approvals, security, processes and properties) for application delivery across a development organization, and to provide guidance to development teams during the application on-boarding process. By using templates, the administrator does not spend time and effort conducting reviews, documenting updates, and providing support. The administrator is guided through the template creation process and does not need to move between pages in the product UI to create them.


A development lead can quickly define an application to UrbanCode Deploy by using the application templates created by a centralized tool administrator, without assistance, eliminating the need to switch between pages in the product UI, and requiring much fewer steps and information to input that would otherwise be required without templates.




Enhanced Deployment support for the Mainframe
---------------------------------------------


A System z programmer can now:


- Design and reuse deployment processes for z/OS applications that capture corporate security standards. Using automated process for deployment ensures proactive and compliance of security standards across systems

- Store z/OS packages in UrbanCode Deploy code station and download the packages more securely, with fewer steps

- Design and execute a deploy process (including submit JCL) using impersonation in z/OS with authorization managed by the native z/OS security framework



A Rational Team Concert build engineer, using RTC 6.0, can now:


- Integrate the build into UrbanCode Deploy without having to write any custom coding

- Create a package in RTC using one of the support methods (shiplist, workitem) and deploy it using UrbanCode Deploy

- By using the out-of-the-box RTC integration, the administrator can seamlessly push RTC build and package results to UrbanCode Deploy and eliminate the need to write an integration script.




New Integrations and support
----------------------------



- Enhanced support for Docker containers: [Docker Plugin on DeveloperWorks](https://urbancode.github.io/IBM-UCx-PLUGIN-DOCS/UCD/docker-plugin/)

- Docker for Linux on z – read the [white paper](http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?subtype=WH&infotype=SA&htmlfid=ZSW03286USEN&attachment=ZSW03286USEN.PDF)

- New plugin for IBM i from partner ARCAD [Link to IBM i plugin on DeveloperWorks](https://urbancode.github.io/IBM-UCx-PLUGIN-DOCS/UCD)

- Support for OpenStack Kilo for cloud blueprints

Release Summary
---------------

  
* Application Templates
* Enhanced Deployment support for Mainframe
* Integration improvements

Release Notes
-------------

  

For information on documentation and support resources, software and hardware requirements and installation steps, see the [Getting Started](../getting-started) page.





Agent Compatibility Note
* Agents used to import new component versions will need to be upgraded to agent version 6.1.0.4. If older agents are used, version import tasks will fail with the following error:

```
Exception in thread "main" java/nio/charset/IllegalCharsetNameException: ${DS\_SYSTEM\_ENCODING}
```
* Due to changes in communication, if you leverage the integration with the Rational Team Concert build, you must first upgrade your RTC server to 5.0.2.





Agent Status Tracking Improvements
This release improves agent status tracking for agents connection through agent relays and in HA environments. For best results, it is necessary to upgrade agent relays. Without these upgrades, agent status tracking for agents connected through relays is unreliable.





Behavioral Changes
This release contains an updated version of the File Utils plugin. If you use the Middleware Configuration for WebSphere Application Server plugin, please ensure you upgrade to version 8.141002 of the plugin.

Getting Started
---------------

  

Plan & Prepare
For fixes contained in this release, and any known issues, review the [release notes](../release-notes).


For supported platforms and requirements, see the [system requirements](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038801). Note that some supported plug-ins have system requirements that vary from the core product. Information on system requirements for individual plug-ins is available on the download page for that plug-in.


To get started quickly to try the software, IBM UrbanCode Deploy is shipped with an Apache Derby database. Apache Derby deployments are not supported for production environments. As you plan your production topology, review the [installation guide](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS4GSP_6.2.0/com.ibm.udeploy.install.doc/topics/install_ch.html)


For advanced enterprise deployments that require high availability, review our options in the [information center.](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS4GSP_6.2.0)


IBM UrbanCode Deploy supports integrations with many different tools available from both IBM as well as other vendors in the form of component process steps. Each IBM UrbanCode Deploy plug-in is a separate download and installation available on our [plug-in page](https://urbancode.github.io/IBM-UCx-PLUGIN-DOCS/UCD).





If you’re upgrading from 6.0…
UrbanCode Deploy 6.1 introduced scalability enhancements to agent/server communication. **All agent relays must be upgraded before running any deployments.** All existing agents will continue to work without an upgrade, but they should be upgraded using the Upgrade action on the agent list in the web UI as soon as possible after upgrading. **Any newly installed agents must be version 6.1.** The latest agent and agent relay installers will be available on your UrbanCode Deploy server’s Tools page (in the Help menu) after the server is upgraded.


UrbanCode Deploy 6.1 also includes a more scalable artifact storage system. After upgrading your server, a background process will migrate artifacts into the new format. You can continue to access and deploy artifacts during this process, but **there will need to be at least as much free disk space in the server’s var/repository directory as is currently being used by that directory**. (If you currently have 25GB of artifacts, you need 25GB of additional free disk space.) The extra disk space is no longer needed after all artifacts have been migrated.




Install the server
This release is available for download for Passport Advantage and Passport Advantage Express clients, requiring authentication. This download is available [here](https://www-112.ibm.com/software/howtobuy/softwareandservices/passportadvantage).


Information for installing the server, see the [Installing servers and agents](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS4GSP_6.2.0/com.ibm.udeploy.install.doc/topics/install_ch.html) section in the product documentation.
