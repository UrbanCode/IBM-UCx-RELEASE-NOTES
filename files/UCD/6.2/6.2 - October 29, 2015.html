<h2>Application Templates</h2>
<p>Design once and reuse many times to enforce standards across an organization and facilitate the onboarding of new teams and applications</p>
<p>With this new feature, a centralized tool administrator can define and update application templates to enforce standards (approvals, security, processes and properties) for application delivery across a development organization, and to provide guidance to development teams during the application on-boarding process. By using templates, the administrator does not spend time and effort conducting reviews, documenting updates, and providing support. The administrator is guided through the template creation process and does not need to move between pages in the product UI to create them.</p>
<p>A development lead can quickly define an application to UrbanCode Deploy by using the application templates created by a centralized tool administrator, without assistance, eliminating the need to switch between pages in the product UI, and requiring much fewer steps and information to input that would otherwise be required without templates.</p>

<h2>Enhanced Deployment support for the Mainframe</h2>
<p>A System z programmer can now:</p>
<li>Design and reuse deployment processes for z/OS applications that capture corporate security standards. Using automated process for deployment ensures proactive and compliance of security standards across systems</li>
<li>Store z/OS packages in UrbanCode Deploy code station and download the packages more securely, with fewer steps</li>
<li>Design and execute a deploy process (including submit JCL) using impersonation in z/OS with authorization managed by the native z/OS security framework</li>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>A Rational Team Concert build engineer, using RTC 6.0, can now:</p>
<li>Integrate the build into UrbanCode Deploy without having to write any custom coding</li>
<li>Create a package in RTC using one of the support methods (shiplist, workitem) and deploy it using UrbanCode Deploy</li>
<li>By using the out-of-the-box RTC integration, the administrator can seamlessly push RTC build and package results to UrbanCode Deploy and eliminate the need to write an integration script.</li>
<ul>
</ul>
