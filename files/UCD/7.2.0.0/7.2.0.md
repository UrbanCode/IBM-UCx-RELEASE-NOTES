7.2.0
=====




This release of IBM UrbanCode Deploy is a major release and includes various bug fixes. This release is recommended for all customers.

End-of-support for Java 8
All customers should note that we are officially announcing end-of-support for Java 8 starting June, 2022. Additional information on alternative Java platforms will be communicated later. **Note:** Customers using UrbanCode Deploy on the z/OS platform, please follow the [IBM statement](https://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/ShowDoc.wss?docURL=/common/ssi/rep_ca/8/897/ENUS220-008/index.html&request_locale=en) of direction.
End-of-life for JMS Communication
Starting with 7.2.0.0, agents and relays that use the JMS communication protocol will no longer be able to connect to the UrbanCode server. Agents and Relays will need to be migrated to the Web communication type in order to connect.
JAVA\_OPTS option for source-control / non-Groovy plug-ins
Previously, it was possible to set the JVM options for agents, agent relays, Deploy servers, and automation plug-ins, but not for the source-control plug-ins. Users can now configure JAVA\_OPTS for source-control and non-Groovy plug-ins. Setting the custom JVM parameters for source-control plug-ins can help you in debugging and performance improvements.
