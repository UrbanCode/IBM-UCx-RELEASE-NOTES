7.0.5.4
=======




IBM UrbanCode Deploy version 7.0.5.4 is a maintenance release and includes security related fixes. This release is recommended for all customers currently on the UrbanCode Deploy 7.0.5.x stream.

It should be noted that the UCD Agent included with this server build is the same agent provided in the 7.0.5.3.ifix01 release. This is due to the fact that no security vulnerabilities were fixed between the 7.0.5.3.ifix01 build and this 7.0.5.4 security release, so there was no need to update the agent. The 7.0.5.3.ifix01 agent is still compatible with 7.0.5.4.
