Getting Started

IMPORTANT
IBM UrbanCode Deploy 6.2.1.2 does not support upgrades if you are using DB2 on a z/OS server. If you attempt to upgrade by using this fix pack, an error message is displayed and the upgrade does not occur. Do not upgrade to the 6.2.1.2 fixpack if you use DB2 on z/OS. A fix is being planned for a future release.


If you are upgrading to version 6.2.1.1 or later, to ensure that all secure property values are obscured, the values of all properties in the history for existing deployments are obscured. In the deployment history for deployments that you run after you upgrade, only secure properties are obscured in the logs.


When you upgrade to version 6.2.1.2 of IBM UrbanCode Deploy, new security features erase old component version import logs to hide secure information. If you want to keep the logs, in the `installed.properties` file, set the  



If you are upgrading from a previous version of IBM UrbanCode Deploy, you might be affected by changes to the security features in the product. After upgrading, any security type that previously had edit permission will automatically have all of the associated edit sub-permissions that were introduced with the new version of IBM UrbanCode Deploy. For example, if the cloud connection type had the edit permission granted, then after upgrading, the cloud connection type will have the **Delete**, **Edit Basic Settings**, and **Manage Teams** sub-permissions.
